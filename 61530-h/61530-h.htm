</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The trail begins at the Broken Tree
with the hawk’s nest. As often as we
have talked of it since, Herman and
I, and that is as often as the ceanothus
blooms untimely for a sign of rains delayed,
or there is a low moon and a following
star, or a wind out of the south with the
smell of wild honey in it, we have agreed together
that the trail begins at Broken Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were some other landmarks I was
quite as sure of at the time, but the creek
makes so many turns here I could never find
them again, and the second time of Herman’s
going in, he had altogether other things to
think about. So as often as we have occasion
to talk of it, we end by saying that it begins
at Broken Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>I remember very well how Fairshore
looked that day as we stood gazing back at it
from the edge of the plowed lands; the pines
sketched blackly against the smudgy, fawn-colored
slope, the sea as blue as lazuli, and the
leaning surf. I had another reason for remembering
it, since it was the last time of
Herman’s asking and of my refusing to marry
him. I don’t know why Herman’s being a
professor of sociology should have led him to
suppose that our liking the same sort of books
and much the same people, and having between
us an income fairly adequate to the exigencies
of comfortable living, should have
been reason enough for my marrying him, but
he had spent a great deal of time that summer
trying to convince me that it was. I recall
being rather short with him that afternoon.
For, in the first place, if I had meant to
marry Herman I should not have put all I
had into a house at Fairshore, and in the next
place, though I had not got to the point of
admitting it, the house was proving rather a
failure.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a long time I had believed that it needed
but a little space of collected quietness for
the vague presages of my spirit to burst freely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>into power. Somewhere within myself I was
aware of a vast, undiscovered country full of
wandering lights and crying voices, from
whence the springs of great undertakings
should issue. But now that the house was accomplished
and my position in the English
Department definitely resigned, all that I had
got by it was an insuperable dryness of heart
and a great deal of time which hung rather
heavily upon my hands. I had done no work
at Fairshore that I was willing to confess to in
print. I know I should not, until I could escape
from this inward desertness into that
quarter from whence still, at times, I could
feel a wind blowing that trumpeted up all the
lagging forces of my soul. And just when I
was wanting most to know passion and great
freedom of feeling, Herman’s offer of a reasonable
marriage, of which the particular
recommendation was that no feeling went to
it, took on the complexion of a personal
affront. The more so since there was no very
definite way in which I could make clear to
Herman just what offended me.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was going on that afternoon to explain
to me how, in a marriage free from the disturbances
of passion incidental to temperamental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>matings, I should be at ease to give
myself wholly to the business of book-making.
With all his understanding, Herman was
fully possessed of that Academic notion that
literature can be produced by taking pains instead
of having them. He was very patient
with me through it all, crediting my indifference
to overwork and to nerves, as a man does
with a woman when he is at a loss to know
what is the matter with her. The truth was,
if I was tired of anything, it was of being the
very things Herman most admired in me. I
was growing every moment more exasperated.
By the time he had got to the point of wanting
to know what more there was that he could
say, I had reached the pitch of replying that
there could be nothing more unless he wished
to say the usual thing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And that?” He turned to me with a sincere
and astonished inquiry in his lifted
brows.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would be merely that you love me and
can’t live without me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, if you want me to say what the grocer’s
man says to the cook in the kitchen!”—he
flushed—“but you know very well,
Mona, that I am not going to insult your intelligence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and mine with the clap-trap of passion.
Certainly I’ve no such cheap sort of
feeling for you, and I’m not such an infernal
cad as to suppose you have——Mona?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It might have been the wind that blew
from the country beyond Broken Tree at that
moment, or something in my face, that turned
that last repetition of my name upon the point
of interrogation. Though it was my crying
objection to Herman that he could not produce
in me those raptures and alarms and
whirlings to and fro, out of which I knew all
creative art to proceed, yet to have him so
renounce for us both the possibility of such a
relation filled me with sudden wounding and
affront. And at that, or at some new shadow
of wonder in his eyes with the turning of his
voice upon the word, I found myself so little
able to give back look for look, that it was a
great relief to me to discover the hawk’s nest
in the Broken Tree. The creek makes a turn
here, and the stepping-stones were so far apart
it was necessary for Herman to go ahead and
reach me back his hand. As I swung past him
I heard him say my name again with so new
a touch of shamed credulity that I was glad
to put my hand up over my eyes, making believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>I had not heard him, and look very attentively
at Broken Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>It stands on the upper bank of the creek,
snapped off midway by the wind. Below the
break two great sweeping boughs spread
either way like the arms of a guide-post. The
nest is in the splintered hollow of the trunk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a nest,” I said, as though a doubt I
had were the reason for my not hearing him.
Herman was so used to this sort of interruption
when we walked in the woods together
that I hoped it had a natural sound. He answered
quite simply that if it was, it should
be empty by this time of the year. Suddenly
the hawk, unfurling from the upper
branches, pitched a slow downward spiral
above our heads, then beat back into upper
air, uttering sharp cries, and, settling slowly
to the left, preened himself and neglected us.
As if being but a watchman, having cried our
coming, he had no other interest in the affair.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just beyond the pine there was a thicket
of wild lilac grown across the way, and as I
put up my hand to defend my face, I saw that
a light spray of it had burst untimely into
bloom. Though this was the second week in
October the grass was brittle as new silk and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the earth was hard with drought. I remember
holding the branch toward Herman for him
to see.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look how it calls the rain,” I said, and
perhaps something more, though I do not remember
what, about the effort of nature to
rise to its own expectancy. I said that first
because it was exactly the sort of thing I knew
Herman, who thought he had entirely rationalized
his attitude toward out of doors, liked
least to hear me say. But, perhaps, because
the shadow of the adventure which was to
prove him wrong about that and so many
things was already over us, he had no answer
but to reach out across my shoulder and put
up his hand over mine to bear back the heavy
branch. This was so little the sort of thing I
had learned to expect of Herman, and we were
both so embarrassed by it, that we could never
be quite sure which of us saw it first. When
we had pushed aside the ceanothus there lay
the beginning of the trail.</p>

<p class='c010'>It began directly at the foot of the pine as
though there was some reason for it, and ran
shallow and well-defined through the lilac
thicket and up the hill.</p>

<p class='c010'>Herman said it was a deer trail. To the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>casual eye it did resemble one of those woodland
tracks made by wild creatures, beginning
at no particular point, and after continuing
clear and direct for a little distance,
breaking off for no reason. But there was
about this trail a subtlety, a nuance, slight distinctions
in the way the scrub was bent back
from it, in the way it took the slope of the hill,
that made it plainly a man trail. More than
that, I felt the slight pricking of the blood, the
quick response of the intelligence to the stimulus
of variations so slight the observation of
them lies almost below the plane of consciousness.
Herman, wanting such witness in himself,
could not believe, and was concerned
over my mistake. So we went on walking in
it, Herman very well satisfied with his argument,
and I saying nothing more about it.
As I frequently have to do when Herman gets
talking of the things which are my province.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was very quiet in the wood that day,
scarcely a bird abroad; now and then a still,
winged insect threaded the green and gold
arcades of the great fern, or a long sigh from
the sea, passed up the hill along the top of the
pines.</p>

<p class='c010'>The trail cleared the scrub and went between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>young trees, skirting a hollow planted
with lean, sombre boles. The ground beneath
was white with the droppings of shadow-haunting
birds. Beyond that there was more
open going among splay-footed oaks, crusted
thick with emerald moss, all a-drip from their
outer branches with the filmy lace of lichen.
Then a pleasant grassy space of pines before
the close locked redwoods began.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not know how long we had been following
before we heard the jays, but we had
come into a little open glade where lilies grew,
through which the trail seemed to lead to
one of those places where you have always
wished to be. There we heard them crying our
approach. Herman said they were jays, and
the first one might have been. I know the
high, strident call they have, which another
hears and repeats, and another, until all the
wood is cautious and awake. But one jay calls
exactly like every other, and about this there
was a modulation that assured while it
warned; that said: “I have heard; have no
concern for me.” And even I could not have
fancied so much as that in the mere squawking
of jays.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be still,” I said to Herman, who was protesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>cheerfully behind me; “you have
waked the wood people and now we shan’t see
any of them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What people?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The people who walk in the woods and
leave the meadows warm and tender, whom
you feel by the pricking between your shoulders
when you come upon the places where
they have been. The people who made this
trail, whom we heard calling one to another
just now. <i>The</i> people——” And just then
we came upon the faggot.</p>

<p class='c010'>It lay close beside the trail, little sticks all
in order except a last handful dropped hurriedly
on top when the faggot-gatherer had
started at our approach.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look!” I said; “that is what they were
doing when we came stumbling on them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It <i>was</i> a faggot, I shall always insist that it
was a faggot, and I should have said so if
nothing had happened afterward to prove it.
Herman kicked it impatiently with his foot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s a literary temperament for you,”
he protested. “You find a trail made by
wood-choppers, you hear jays squawking and
see a heap of brushwood. Straightway you
create a race of people to account for them.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“You <i>said</i> it was a deer trail a while ago,” I
hinted, and Herman laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was still and warm in the glade; the
needles lay thick and soft and no grass grew.
The scent of the yerba buena stole upon us
intermittently, delicate pungent gusts answering
each to each like speech. All around the
sunlight lay, a thing palpable, as if, like the
needles, it had not been lifted for a thousand
years, but mellowed there like wine. Herman
stretched himself on the brown thick litter beside
me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aha,” he said, “if this belongs to your
wood people they know a good thing. It’s
very nice of them to lend it to us for a while.
I don’t seem to feel any pricks between my
shoulders, but my heart beats remarkably; so
don’t give me up yet, Mona.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That was exactly like Herman, to argue
with your best beliefs until you begin to think
there is no other way than to subvert your
whole scheme of existence, or to break off all
connection with him. And then he abandons
his position with a suddenness that leaves you
toppling over your own defenses.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment I thought he might be going
to revert to the matter of my marrying him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>but he lay tossing lightly at the dropped
needles, and the even breathing silence of the
wood closed in again. We sat so long that we
were startled on discovering that if Herman
got back to the Inn in time for the stage that
was to take him to his train, we would have
to run for it. And that, I suppose, was why
we took so little notice of the landmarks going
out, that, though I tried the very next afternoon,
I could not find the trail again.</p>

<p class='c010'>I wanted to find it too, for if I could once
prove to Herman that there was a reality behind
that sense of presence in the woods he
credited to the whimseys of a literary imagination,
I should somehow put myself in a better
case for proving—well, I did not know
quite what, but I wanted to find that trail.</p>

<p class='c010'>I tried that day and the next. Twice I found
the glade and the sun-steeped yerba buena, for
the day was warm and the scent of it carried
far, and once I got past Broken Tree, but I
could never come into the trail in any manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then one day when I had almost given up
finding it, and had been a long time in the
woods without thinking about it, I found myself
walking in the glade again, and the first
thing I noticed was that the faggot was gone.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Although I had been so sure of its being a faggot
in the first place, I was a little startled at
missing it, but not in the least alarmed. The
day was full of the warm dry fog that goes
before a rain; it cleared the ground and curled
midway of the tall, fluted trees like altar
smoke. I followed along the track, which ran
narrowly between the redwood boles toward
an open space, at the back of which was the
pool of a spring. It gleamed under a leaning
bay tree, silver tipped with light. And there
beside it was a man who so matched with the
color of the dappled earth that, except for
the motions of his singular employment, I
might have missed seeing him altogether. He
was of a long clean shape, dressed as to
the upper part of his body in a close-fitting
coat of gray mole-skin. His feet were covered
with sandals. Long bands of leather and
of a green cloth, coarse like linen, were laced
about, midway of his thighs. His coat had
been loosened at the shoulders, baring his
breast and arms, and as he lay on the bank of
the pool, he leaned above it and studied the
reflection of his face. He had leaves of some
strange herb in his hand which he squeezed together,
and having dipped it in the water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>rubbed upon his face and hair, watching the
effect in the pool.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was his hair that caught my attention
most, for it was thick and waving, and most
singularly streaked with white. That was the
more strange because the body of him looked
lithe and young. It occurred to me that he
might be remedying an offensive grayness
as he dipped and rubbed and stooped to
mirror himself the better in the bright water.
But before I had made up my mind to anything
further, he turned and saw me.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first thing he did was to thrust the hand
that held the herb straight down into the water
with a deliberate movement—all the while
holding my gaze with great fixity of purpose,
as though he would not so much as let it question
what he did. Presently withdrawing the
hand empty, he stood up.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he drew erect and clasped the upper
part of his tunic, I saw that around his body
was a sort of sash of green cloth wrapped
several times, and stuck through the folds of
it, various tools of the cruder sort of silversmiths.
Also, though his figure was young,
the skin of his face was drawn in fine wrinkles.
He had a thin, high nose with a slightly mobile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>tip that seemed to twitch a little with distrust
as he looked at me. The mouth below
it was full and curved, his eyes bluish black,
opaque and velvet-looking; windows out of
which came and looked boldness, cunning and
power, and the wistfulness of the wild creature
questioning its kinship with man. All
this without so much as altering a muscle of
his face or removing his gaze from mine.
Then he stepped back a pace against the
yielding boughs, which seemed to give like
doors, and received him without crackling or
sensible displacement into the silence of the
wood.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>II<br /> <span class='large'>I MEET THE OUTLIERS IN THE WOOD AND HERMAN COMES TO FIND ME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>When Herman got my letter
concerning the dark man under
the bay tree, he was wholly
at loss what to make of it. He
was quite habituated to my method of making
believe to be a story before writing
it, and was always willing to play up to his
part as soon as he learned what that was, but
in this case I had neglected to tell him. While
he was reading the letter over, it occurred to
him the whole thing might be merely a childish
pique because he had scoffed at my wood
people in the first place, and was rather annoyed
at it.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as often as he went back to the letter
he found a note of conviction in it—for I had
written it immediately after the adventure—that
overrode both of these interpretations.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>After that he was divided between the fear
that I really had been overworking and a period
of mild hallucination had set in, or the
possibility that I could have met some sort of
wild person in the forest who might do me an
injury. The most disturbing thing in the letter
was the declaration that I meant to go back
as soon as I could and find out all about the
woodlander. The result of all this was that
after having written me a separate letter based
on each one of these beliefs, and having destroyed
it, Herman left the University Friday
morning and came down to find out, if possible,
what really had occurred.</p>

<p class='c010'>He arrived on the stage that reaches Fairshore
at half-past one, and as he had come directly
from his lecture room, he had first to
have lunch and change to his out-of-door
clothes. This made it the middle of the afternoon
before he reached the cottage. As soon
as he had a glimpse of it, he experienced a
sinking of the heart that warned him that I
was not there. However, he went through
the formality of knocking at the front door
before going round to see if I had left the
key, as I did for short absences, or had taken
it to the Inn as when I meant to be away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>several days. He found the key in the accustomed
place, and something more alarming.
Inside the screened porch at the back were the
three little bottles of milk which the milkman
had left there each evening that I had been
away. So I had been gone three days!</p>

<p class='c010'>The first thing was to make sure that I was
not at Mira Monte or at Idlewild, where I
went sometimes as the mood demanded. He
was very cautious about making inquiries at
the post-office and the Inn, for, of course, I
hadn’t given Herman any right to be interested
in my whereabouts. And, of course, if I
really had gone off to hunt for hypothetical
people in the woods, I shouldn’t want it talked
about. At the end of an hour he had learned
nothing more definite than that if I had
gone out of town it had not been by the
regular stages, and nobody knew when or
where.</p>

<p class='c010'>He decided then that the occasion justified
his going into the house to find out if I had
taken my suit-case, or anything that would
give a clue. By the time he got back to the
cottage it was past four o’clock, and the milkman
had been his round. There were now
four little bottles on the ledge. This somehow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>seemed to Herman so alarming a circumstance,
with its implication of unexpected detention,
that with scarcely more than a glance
about the house, he put some crackers and my
traveling flask into his pocket and set out almost
running for Broken Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>He said that he found the place with very
little difficulty, and without noticing particularly
the way he came. I have thought since
it might be one of the conditions of going
there, that you must be thinking altogether of
other matters and be concerned in the going
for something more than yourself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Herman found the trail and followed it as
far as the place of the faggot, and on to the
point where I had seen the tall man washing
his hair at the spring. Though he could have
had no reasonable expectation he had unconsciously
counted on finding some trace of me
in that neighborhood, and, disappointed in
that, was at loss what to do. The trail,
which ran out indistinguishably in the
meadow, began again on the other side.
After losing half an hour in picking it up
again, he came on half fearfully, anticipating
he knew not what dread evidence at every
turn.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The redwoods grew close here and the space
between was filled with bluish gloom shot
with long arrows of the westering sun. The
trail ran crookedly among the clutching roots.
Stumbling near-sightedly among them, he lost
it wholly and so came by accident upon what
otherwise he might have missed. Where the
forest sheered away from a blank, stony ledge
sticking out of a hill, there was a clear space
with some small ferns and a seeping spring.
In the soft earth about it he found prints of
feet he thought to be mine, and beside it, broad
and strong, the heavy feet of men. It was by
now nearly dark, and Herman was so genuinely
alarmed and so poor a woodman that he
knew no better than to dash back among the
redwoods hunting wildly for the trail and
shouting, “Mona! Mona!” for all the wood to
hear.</p>

<p class='c010'>What had really happened to me was
alarming enough to think of, though in truth
I had not been very much alarmed by it at the
time. The morning after my writing to Herman
had been one of those pricking days that
come in the turn of the seasons. Such a sparkle
on the approaching water, such a trumpeting
from the hills, the high vault full of flying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>cloud, that I struck with great confidence into
the trail some distance beyond Broken Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>I followed along where it ran in a space
wide as a wagon track, and opened into a
meadow full of the airy whiteness of small
bloom, floating above the late yellow lilies and
the glinting grass. I sat down at its farther
ledge, leaning against the curled roots of the
redwood, and got as much comfort from it as
though I had been propped by a human shoulder,
so full was all the earth of friendly
warmth and quietness.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was neither sun nor shadow nor moving
wind. I sat and browsed along the edge
of sleep, slipped in and out, dozed and woke
to watch the lilies: lost myself, and snapped
alert to see the eyes of a man, ruddy and well-looking,
fixed upon me from between the
shouldering trees. Not a twig had snapped
nor one bough clicked against another, but
there he stood like a stag gazing, uncurious
and at ease. When he perceived that I was
aware of him he stepped toward me, throwing
up his head, uttering the high strident cry of
jays, followed by one bird-call and another,
which seemed to be answered in kind from
within the forest.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>He was a man of about forty, burned by the
sun with thick, tawny locks and a pointed,
russet beard, wearing a single garment of untanned
skin that came midway of his arms
and thighs. There were sandals on his feet
and strips of leather bound about protected
him to the knees. He was belted about the
body with a curious implement that might
have been a sling, and from his hand swung a
brace or two of quail.</p>

<p class='c010'>The singular part of this adventure was
that while he stood there communicating in
his strange wordless fashion with all the birds
in the woods, I was not afraid. He was standing
over me in such a manner that I could not
have escaped him if I would. Really I had no
thought of doing so, but sat looking as he
looked at me, and not in the least afraid.</p>

<p class='c010'>So occupied were we both with this mutual
inspection that I did not quite know how nor
from what quarter three men came out from
among the trees and stood beside him. One
of them was red and sturdy like the first, one
was old, with a white beard curling back from
his face like the surf from a rock, but exceedingly
well built and with great heaps of gnarly
muscles along his breast and arms. The third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>was the dark man I had seen washing his hair
at the pool of the Leaning Bay.</p>

<p class='c010'>They all looked at me with amazement and
some consternation. Words passed between
them in a strange tongue, though it was plain
they referred to the manner of their finding
me, and what was to be done about it. At
length, the old man having said something to
the effect that whatever I might be I did not
appear particularly dangerous, they laughed,
all of them, and made a sign that I was to
come with them along the trail.</p>

<p class='c010'>We moved slowly; my captors, for so I was
to regard them, so disposing themselves as we
went that I was scarcely aware of them. We
moved stealthily from bole to bole, mingling
so with the tawny and amber shadows, that
time by time I hesitated, thinking myself
abandoned. Then I heard the old man’s
throaty chuckle like the movement of slow
water among stones, or caught the bright, regardful
eyes of Ravenutzi fixed upon me from
behind the interlacing boughs.</p>

<p class='c010'>After an hour’s walking we came to a
bramble-fenced hollow, ringed with very tall
trees, smelling of the sun. Here there might
be a dozen of the wood folks, with four women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>among them, lying up like deer through the
bright betraying noon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Almost the first thing I noticed was that
there was no curiosity among them of a prying
sort over my appearance, and no fear. As
if they had never imagined that one of my sort
could do them harm. But there was regretfulness,
particularly among the women, that
appeared to be strangely for my sake, and a
very grave concern. Moreover, when I spoke,—for
I was moved to speak at once and declare
that whatever the appearance of my
coming among them, I meant no harm,—they
turned all toward me, as if merely by attending
quietly on this strange tongue they could
make out what was said. I presently discovered
that they had made it out, and by keeping
this same considered quietness, without
straining or trying to think what the words
were, I was able to know what went on about
me. Although it was several days before I
could communicate fully, and I do not know
yet, nor does Herman know, what language
the Outliers spoke among themselves, we were
able to get along very well in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>They drew around me in a circle, which
was left open at one side to admit a man whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>I guessed at once by his bearing, as well as the
deference they paid him, to be some sort of
chief to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was of a singular and appealing beauty,
so that his bodily excellence was a garment
to him, and adorned the simplicity of his dress.
There was that in his way of standing which
moved one to go up and lay hand on him as on
the stem of a young cedar. But something
stood within him that protected him more
than a weapon from such impersonality. As
he waited to hear the account of me which the
red man gave, I felt I had never such a wish
to have a man think well of me, nor been so
much at a loss how to begin it. At the same
time he seemed to be hearkening to something
within himself, something that, when he asked
a question of the women (which passed from
one to another of them with something of denial
and disclaimer), seemed to speak more
loudly. The question appeared to refer to
something which should have settled my business
then and there. The neglect of it devolved
upon a woman, comely and perplexed,
as though given to too great a sense of responsibility,
and much overcome at being found
at fault.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“No matter,” he said to her excuses, and
bending a troubled look on me, the doubt in
him spoke out openly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was of this, I think, <i>she</i> spoke to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At that slight emphasis the dark man who
had the smith’s tools on him, looked at me
with so sharp and surprising an interest that it
distracted me from noticing who it was behind
me asked with some eagerness:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of what did she speak?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That there was one walking toward us
on the trail, bearing trouble. On the morning
of our leaving, she waked me early to
say it. I am thinking this is the one. If you
have forgotten the cup, Evarra, it is an omen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The interest of all the wood folk reawakened.
They began to regard me with so much
distrust that I was relieved when the chief
made a sign to Noche to take me a little to
one side. Thus they talk more freely, looking
at me from time to time, sometimes seeming
to blame the woman, and sometimes to praise
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Noche was that same old man who had
brought me from the neighborhood of Broken
Tree, whose mild blue eyes, set rather shallowly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>in a broad face, continued to reassure
me.</p>

<p class='c010'>He sat off a considerate distance, and busied
himself with plaiting of leather thongs. All
his features were rugged, the mouth wide, the
nose broad and open at the nostrils, but blunted
all as if by some yielding humor in him
which fitted oddly with the knotting of his
muscles. Now and then he turned toward me
with chuckling, slow laughter which served
in place of comforting speech.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever conclusion the woodlanders came
to about me, it was not to take immediate effect.
They talked or lay quietly in the fern as
deer lie. They slept much, but always with
some on guard, dropping off with even breathing
peace, and waking without start or stretching,
as if wakefulness were but a wind that
stirred them by times, and sleep the cessation
of the stir.</p>

<p class='c010'>Toward evening they rose and cooked a
meal, of which I had my share—deer meat,
wild honey in the honey-comb, and some
strange bread. Two or three others came in
from hunting; they were dressed much the
same as the red man who had found me, and
carried slings in their belts or slung upon their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>shoulders. The west was red and the pines
black against it. There rose a light ruffle of
wind and sighed through the wood. With it
passed through the camp an audible breath of
expectation. One of the women stood up with
water in a bowl of bark, holding it high above
her head in the manner of one celebrating a
ritual, crooning some words to which the
others made a breathy, soft response. She
turned the water out upon the fire, the ashes
of which Noche deftly covered, then, extending
the bowl toward the young leader, she
smiled, saying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The word is with you, Persilope.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He took the vessel from her, scattering its
few remaining drops westward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To the sea!” he said; “down to the sea!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To the sea!” cried the Outliers, and
laughed and girt themselves. Suddenly I
found myself caught up into a kind of litter
or swing made of broad bands of skin, in a
position of great uneasiness to myself, between
the shoulders of two men. The whole body
of woodlanders set off rapidly, but in their
former noiseless fashion, going seaward.</p>

<p class='c010'>The moon was up and the tide far out when
we issued upon the promontory called Cypress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Point. There was little surf, and the glimmer
of the tide ran like silvered serpents all along
the rocks. With a shout the Outliers stripped
and cut the molten water with their shining
bodies; laughed and plunged and rose again,
laughing and blowing the spray as long as the
moon lasted. They were at it again with the
earliest light, and I should have known they
were gathering sea food without what one of
the women told me, of a great occasion going
forward at their home which lay far from
here, and a great feast of all the tribe. When
the tide allowed, they gathered fish and abalones,
which the women carried to some secret
place among the pines to cure and dry.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the tide was up the Outliers lay by
in the dark rooms of cypress, bedded on the
thick, resistant boughs, or stretched along the
ancient trunks so wried and bent to purposes
of concealment. Often in the heat, when there
was cessation of the low whispering tones and
light easy laughter, I would rise up suddenly
seeming to myself quite alone only to discover
by the stir of the wind on hair or garment
the watchers lying close, untroubled and observant.
While they worked I lay bound lightly
under the wind-depressed cypresses where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>no light reached, but strange checkered gleams
of it like phosphorescent eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>By night I could hear the Outliers shouting
strongly in the surf, and saw by day the Chinese
fishing-boats from Pescadera crawl along
the rocks, and the smoke of coasting steamers
trailing a shadow like a dark snake on the
sea’s surface, polished by the heat. The men
worked with good-will and laughter, always
with watchers out. If one moment they were
hauling at the nets, at a mere squeak of warning
there would not be to the unpracticed eye
so much as the glint of the sun on bare skin.
Once a great red car came careering around
the point, all the occupants absorbed in
Bridge, just when the sea was at its best, a sapphire
sparkle moving under an enchanted mist
and the land luminous with reflected light.</p>

<p class='c010'>We could see the casual turning of the owner’s
head as some invisible string from the
guard’s stretched, pointed finger seemed to
move it like a mechanical toy. Almost before
it rounded the curve, old Noche took himself
out of the seaweed and blew foam at them in
derision.</p>

<p class='c010'>The care and keeping of me fell to Evarra,
by whose neglect a proper dealing with me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>was kept in abeyance, and to old Noche, with
whom I began to be very well acquainted.
Noche had the soul of a craftsman, though
with no very great gift. Whenever the smith
was busy at a forge improvised of two
beach stones and a flint, mending fishhooks
and hammering spear-heads from bits of
metal picked up along the sand, Noche would
choose to lie puffing his cheeks to blow the
fire while Ravenutzi fitted his movements to
the rhythm of the wind as it rose to cover
the light clink of his hammers. Or the old
man would sit with his lips a little apart and
in his eyes the bright fixity of a child’s, laying
out iridescent fragments of abalone in curious
patterns in which Ravenutzi took the
greatest interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was singular to me that the design the
old man struggled with oftenest, the smith let
pass. I had observed this the more because I
became sure that there was no smallest hint
of it escaped him, and the suspicion was fixed
in my mind by its revelation of a great singularity
in the character of Ravenutzi himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Time and again I had seen Noche laying
out his abalone pearls in a design which, however
dearly it was borne within his mind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>seemed reluctant in expression. He would
place the salient points of his pattern, connecting
them by tracings in the sand, and when he
had taken the greatest pains with it, startled,
would sweep out the whole with his hand.
There were times when its preciousness so
grew upon him that he would not even commit
it to the dust, but formed the delicate outline
with his finger in the air.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of those occasions, when it was full
noon, and the tide charged thunderously along
the coast, all the Outliers lying up in the
windy gloom of the cypresses, I knew by the
absorbed and breathless look of him that
Noche had accomplished for once the whole
of his design. He bent above it crooning in
his beard, so absorbed in the complete and
lonely joy of creation that he neither saw nor
sensed the shifting of the stooped, twisty
trunks above him to the form of Ravenutzi.</p>

<p class='c010'>How he had come there I could not imagine,
but there he bent from the flat-topped
foliage, the mouth avid, the eyes burning and
curious. As the shifting of his position
brought him into line with my gaze he passed
to a fixed intentness that held me arrested
even in the process of thought. It left me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>uncertain as to whether it were not I who had
been caught spying instead of Ravenutzi, and
merely to meet that look in me had been, after
all, the object of his secret scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c010'>And this was what separated him from the
others more than his dark skin and his clipped
and nasal speech, making me sure, before I
had heard a word of the Far-Folk, of some
alien blood in him. Whatever one of the Outliers
did, whether you agreed with him or not,
there was at least no doubt about it.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was how the days were going with
me all the time Herman was writing me letters
and tearing them up again, deciding that
I was mad or foolish or both.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the evening of the last day, about the
time he had entered on the trail by Broken
Tree, we were setting out for I knew not what
far home of the Outliers. I was carried still
in my litter, but that was more kindness than
captivity, for though I count myself a good
walker, I made poor work of keeping even
with their light, running stride. We were not
many hours out; it was after moonset, and I
had lost all track of the time or the way, being
a little sick with the motion, and very tired of
it. I could guess this much, that we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>rounding a steep and thick-set hill by what
might have been an abandoned wagon road,
for our pace increased here. Suddenly the
company was arrested by sharp resounding
cries and the crackling of underbrush on the
slope above us. So does the night estrange
familiar things, that I could get no clue at
all to what the cries might be, except that it
was some creature blundering and crying distressfully,
making as if to cross our trail.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Outliers were themselves alarmed by
it, and considered a moment whether they
should halt to let it pass before us or hurry
on to leave it behind. But the check and the
beginning of movement had caught the attention
of the lost creature, for it turned directly
toward us, and begun to come on more
rapidly, redoubling its cries. Now I thought,
though it seemed so extraordinary, that it
said “Mona!” in a wild and urgent manner.
Then it seemed to have slipped or bounded,
for the slope was steep, and fell with a great
clatter of stones and snapping of stems directly
in our trail.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several of the men precipitated themselves
upon it. There was a short struggle, muffled
groans, and quiet. One of them struck a light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>from his flint and showed a man, scratched
and disheveled, lifted in the grip of Noche,
lying limp and faint back from the knotted
arms. I turned faint myself to see that it was
Herman.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>It was the very next day, and before I had
learned as much of Herman’s adventure
as I have already set down, that I began
to hear of the Treasure. My hearing
became the means of my knowing all that
happened afterwards in Outland on account
of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the middle of the afternoon when I
came out of Evarra’s hut and found Herman,
with his head bandaged, lying on a heap
of skins with old Noche on guard, plaiting
slings. He had a loop of raw hide about one
foot stretched straight before him to keep it
taut as he plaited. Now and then he turned
his face toward us with a wordless reassurance,
but chiefly his attention was taken by
the children, who cooed and bobbed their
heads together within the shadow.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Back of them the redwoods stood up thick
as organ pipes, and when the wind stirred, the
space above was filled with the click of dropping
needles and the flicker of light displaced.
I was going on to inquire of Herman how he
happened to come stumbling on my trail when
I thought him safe at the University, but
Noche making a noise of disapproval in his
throat, I left off at once, and began to attend
to the talk of the children. It grew clear as I
fixed upon it or lapsed into unmeaning murmurs
as my mind wandered. There were four
or five of them busy about those curious structures
that children build with pebbles and potsherds
and mounds of patted dust, set off by a
feather or a flower. Noche, it appeared, was
very good at this sort of thing. To their great
delight, he was persuaded to undertake a more
imposing mound than they could manage for
themselves; and presently I had made out
idly that the structure in the dust was the pattern
of a story he was telling them. It was
all of a king’s treasure. Seventy bracelets of
gold, he said, all of fine work, chased and
hammered, and belts of linked gold, and
buckles set with colored stones. He took pebbles
from the creek and petals of flowers to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>show them how that was, and every child was
for making one for himself, for Noche to approve.
Also he said there were collars of filigree,
and necklets set with green stones of the
color of the creek where it turned over the
falls at Leaping Water. There were cups of
gold, and one particular goblet of chased work
which an old king held between his knees,
around the rim of which a matchless hunter
forever pursued exquisite deer. The stem
of it was all of honey-colored agate, and in the
base there were four great stones for the colors
of the four Quarters: blue for the North,
green for the South where the wind came from
that made the grass to spring, red for the
Dawn side of earth, and yellow for the West.
And for the same king there was a circlet for
his brows, of fire-stones, by which I supposed
he meant opals, half a finger long, set in beaten
gold. Also there were lamps, jeweled and
chased, on golden chains that hung a-light
above the kings.</p>

<p class='c010'>When then one of the children, who lay listening
with his heels in the air, wished to
know if it were true what his father had said,
that there was evil in the Treasure which came
out upon whoever so much as looked at it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>there came a rueful blankness upon the face of
old Noche.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay,” said he, “and upon whoever so much
as talks of it.” And he shook his neglected
sling at them as though to have left it off for
the sake of a story were a very culpable
matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the children would not have it like that
at all. They flung themselves on him in a
heap, and got upon his back and about his
neck and rumpled his hair, declaring that he
was the best old man that ever was, and he
must tell them about the red necklace: till,
growling a little, but very glad to be beguiled,
Noche went on to say there was a necklace of
red stones so splendid that every one of them
was a little more splendid than the next one.
Almost before he had begun and before Herman
and I had heard anything louder than the
unmeaning forest murmurs, we saw the children
rise to attention, and scatter suddenly,
with gay little splutters of laughter like the
noise of water spilled along the ground. They
disappeared down the trails that ran darkling
among the rooted columns of the trees.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a certain dismay I thought on
Noche’s face as he turned back to his work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>perceiving that I had listened, and not sure
how much I had understood. He began to
talk to us at once about his work, as though
that might have been the object of our attention.
With his hand he reached out furtively
behind him and destroyed all the patterns
in the dust.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still I found my mind going back to the
story with some insistence. Up to that time I
had seen no metal in the camp but some small
pieces of hammered silver and simple tools of
hard iron, and no ornaments but shells and
berries. But there had been a relish in old
Noche’s telling that hinted at reality. I remembered
the pattern which he had pondered
so secretly under the cypress trees, and it came
into my mind in an obscure way, without my
taking any particular notice of it, that this
might be the pattern of the necklace of red
stones. I had not time to think further then,
for the sound to which the children had answered
was the returning hunt and the Outliers
coming toward us on the trail.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was always so that they came together
about the time that the blue haze and the late
light rayed out long level bars across the hills.
They would be awake and about at whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>hour pleased them, and take their nooning in
whatever place. Through the days there
would scarcely be so much seen of them as
a woman beating fiber between two stones
by a brook, or a man cutting fern on a steep
slope. So still they were by use, and so habituated
to the russet earth and the green fern and
the gray stone, that they could melt into it and
disappear. Though you heard close about you
low-toned talk and cheerful laughter, you
could scarcely, unless they wished it, come
bodily upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'>On this evening all those in the neighborhood
of Deep Fern had come together, not
only because of the news of House-Folk
brought to camp, but because this was the time
set for the return of Trastevera from some
errand connected with the great occasion of
which I had been told. It was she who had
seen trouble walking with us on the trail from
Broken Tree, and without whose advisement,
so Evarra had already explained to me, nothing
would be determined concerning Herman
and me.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Trastevera was also the wife of Persilope,
and whatever the business that called her
from Deep Fern that day, she was late returning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>All the Outliers had come in. The light
had left the lower reaches of the forest and
began to shine level through the fan-spread
boughs before Persilope came out of the grass
walk where he had been pacing up and down
restlessly. Advised by some sound or sense
too fine for me, he lifted up his hand toward
that quarter of the thick-set grove that fenced
the far end of the meadow. In the quick attentiveness
that followed on the gesture, he
stood in the flush of rising tenderness until,
with some others behind her, she came lightly
through the wood. One perceived first that
she was smaller than the others, most delicately
shaped, and next, that the years upon
her were like the enrichment of time on some
rare ornament.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not know why in our sort of society it
should always seem regrettable, when not a
little ridiculous, for a woman to be ten years
older than her husband. Since I have known
the exquisite maturity of Trastevera’s spirit,
tempering her husband’s passion to finer appreciation
of her ripened worth, I have not
thought it so. As she came lightly through
the thick grass of the uncropped meadow
there was, as often, a glow upon her that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>might have come from the business she had
been abroad upon. It sustained her a little
above the personal consideration, so that almost
before she had recovered from the flush
of her husband’s embrace, she turned toward
Prassade—the red man who had found me in
the wood—to say that all was as he would
have wished it, and he had good reason for
being pleased. This being apparently a word
he had waited for, he thanked her with a very
honest satisfaction. Then, with her hand still
in Persilope’s, he looking down on her more
rejoiced with having her back from her errand
than with anything she had to say about it, she
turned a puzzled, inquiring glance about the
camp.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ravenutzi?” she questioned doubtfully;
but the smith smiled and shook his head, and
with one consent, as if she had answered expectation,
the company parted and showed us
to her where we stood. Without having any
previous intention about it, I found myself rising
to my feet to meet her, and heard Herman
scramble lamely up behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>She stood so, confronting us without a word
for as long as it took Prassade briefly to explain
how they had taken us, and why they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>had not done that to us which I already understood
had threatened me on the first day of my
captivity. This was long enough for me to
discern that she was darker than the other
Outliers, that her hair must have been about
the color of Ravenutzi’s before it turned. Her
eyes were gray and clouded with amber like
the morning surf. She moved a step toward
me, nodding her head to what the young chief
said, and shaking it slowly to something in
herself. Wonder and perplexity deepened in
her. Delicately, as seeking knowledge of me
and not realizing that I could understand her
speech or answer in it, she drew the tips of
her fingers across my breast. There was no
more offensiveness in the touch than in the
questioning fingers of the blind. Wonder and
perplexity deepening still, she turned back to
Persilope.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I grow an old woman,” she said, “I have
failed you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He took the hand which she put out deprecatingly,
and held it strongly against his
breast, laughing the full, fatuous man’s laugh
of disbelief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When have you failed me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know,” she protested; “I cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>tell;” and I understood that the doubt referred
to her failure to get from me by that contact,
the clew she sought.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surely these are they whom I feared for
you to meet when you set out for the sea by the
cypresses. Not for what they would do to
you”—her look was toward Persilope—“but
for what they might bring to all Outliers.
But now I am not sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She spoke as much to the company at large
as to her husband. The number of them had
increased, until I could see the outer ring
melting into the twilight of the trees, eyes in
formless faces of amazement and alarm. Now
at the admission of a difficulty, they all turned
toward her with that courtesy of inward attention
by which, when one of them would understand
more of a matter than lay directly before
him, each turned his thought upon the subject
gravely for a time, like so many lamps lighted
in a room, and turned it off again with no more
concern when the matter was resolved. But
even as she smiled to acknowledge their help
she shook her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” she repeated, “I cannot tell.” She
turned and looked at me, and I gave her the
look back with so deep a wish to have her understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>that no trouble should come to them
by me, that she must have sensed it, for her
look went on by me and stopped at Herman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You?” she questioned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell her,” said Herman, who had not
caught all the words, but only the general
purport of her speech, “tell her that all we
ask is to go to our own homes, unharmed and
harming no one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now that was not exactly what I had in
mind, for though I would not for worlds have
made trouble for the Outliers, I wished nothing
so little as being sent away before I had
got to know more of them. But before I could
frame a speech to that end, Trastevera spoke
again more lightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now that I have seen them, there seems
nothing in them but kindness and well-meaning.
Indeed it is so unusual a thing that
House-Folk should discover us, that I am not
sure we ought not to pay them some little respect
for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She made me a little whimsical acknowledgment
of this sentiment, but before I could
think of a reply, some slight shifting of the
ringed watchers thrust forward Ravenutzi. I
recalled suddenly what I had neglected to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>state in the midst of Prassade’s explanation,
that his finding me was not the first intimation
I had had of the presence of Outliers in
the neighborhood of Broken Tree. Up to
this time I had observed that when the Outliers
had their heads together on any matter
of immediate concern, it had been Ravenutzi’s
habit to keep a little to one side, as though not
directly affected. Now as I saw him pushed
into the cleared space by the stream side, it
stirred dimly in my mind that the circumstance
of my first meeting with him, which I
had not before mentioned, might mean something.
I hardly understood what.</p>

<p class='c010'>I must have made some motion, some slight
betraying glance which the smith detected.
While the words were in my throat he looked
at me, subtly, somehow encompassingly, as if
he had projected his personality forward until
it filled satisfyingly all my thought. I
no longer thought it worth while to mention
where I had first seen Ravenutzi nor what I
had found him doing. I was taken with a
sudden inexplicable warmth toward him, and
a vague wish to afford him a protection for
which he had not asked and did not apparently
need. Swift as this passage was, I saw that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Trastevera had noted it. Something dimmed
in her, as if her mind had lain at the crossing
of our two glances, Ravenutzi’s and mine, and
been taken in the shadow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For the disposing of the House-Folk,” she
finished evenly, as though this had been in
her mind from the first to say, “you had better
take counsel to decide whether they shall be
given the Cup at once, or be kept to await a
sign.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I saw Persilope stooping to her, urging that
she was tired, that she had come too far that
day, she would be clearer in the morning. She
shook her head still, looking once long at me,
and once almost slyly at the smith, and then
at us no more, but only at her husband, as she
walked slowly along the meadow against the
saffron-tinted sky. Then we were taken away,
Herman and I, to our respective huts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The place called Deep Fern by the Outliers
lay in the middle of three half hollow
basins looking seaward, and clearing all the
intervening hills. Barriers thick set with redwood,
dividing the cupped space like the
ridges of a shell, ran into a hollow full of
broad oaks and brambles. Between the ridges
brooks ran to join the creek that, dropping in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>a white torrent to the basin called Lower Fern,
made a pool there, from which it was also
called Deer Lake Hollow. The upper basin,
long and narrow, was named from the falls,
Leaping Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>The camp of the Outliers lay in one of the
widest of the furrows between the ridges
where the redwoods marched soldierly down
to the stream side. Above it, between Deep
Fern and a place called Bent Bow, lay Council
Hollow. It was there, when the moon was
an hour high, a battered-looking moon, yellow
and low, went all the Outliers to consider what
was to be done about us. It was a windy hollow,
oval shaped, with long white knuckles of
rock sticking out along the rim, where no
trees grew, nothing taller in it than the
shadows of the penstemon which the moon
cast upon the rocks. Whenever the wind
moved, there was a strong smell of sweet grass
and yerba buena. There would have been
about thirty men of the Outliers gathered
when we came up the ridge from Deep Fern.
We halted with the women at a point where
we could see, near to one end, a little fire of
crossed sticks low on the ground. The Outliers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>were at all times sparing of fire and cautious
in the use of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Council had been sitting some time, I
think, upon other matters, when we took up
our station on the rising ground. Trastevera
went down, winding between the rocks
toward the ruddy point of fire. The moon
was moving in a shallow arc not high above
the ranges, and some hurrying clouds scattered
the light. We could see little more than
the stir of her going, the pale discs of faces
or the shining of an arm or shoulder in the
clear space between the shadows of the clouds.</p>

<p class='c010'>She went on quietly, all talk falling off
before her until she stood in the small, lit
circle between the leaders, who inquired formally
of her had she anything to say of importance
on the business of the two strangers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only this,” she said, “that although I was
greatly troubled before they came, by a sense
of danger impending, I am now free from it
so far as the House-Folk are concerned.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But do you,” questioned Prassade, “sense
trouble still, apart from these?” He motioned
toward Herman and me, who had been
brought behind her almost to the circle of
the flare.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Trouble and shadow of change,” she said,
and after a pause: “Shall I speak?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Without waiting for the click of encouragement
that ran about the Hollow, she began:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know all of you that I have, through
no fault, the blood of the Far-Folk, which
has been for a long time the blood of traitors
and falsifiers. And yet never at any time have
I played traitor to you nor brought you uncertain
word, except”—I thought her voice
wavered there—“in the matter of the hostage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>If there had been any wavering it was not
in the councillors, whose attention seemed to
stiffen to the point of expectation as she went
on steadily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When it was a question more than a year
ago whether the Far-Folk should send us their
best man and cunningest as a hostage for accomplished
peace, you know that I was against
it, though I had no reason to give, beyond the
unreasoning troubling of my spirit. Later
when Ravenutzi was brought into our borders,
and I had met with him, there was something
which sang to him in my blood, and a sense of
bond replaced the presentiment. All of which
I truly admitted to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So still her audience was, so shadowed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>the drift of cloud, that she seemed, as she stood
with her face whitened by the moon, and the
low fire glinting the folds of her dress, to be
explaining herself to herself alone, and to admit
the need of explanation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And because,” she said, “I could not be
sure if it was a foreseeing, or merely my traitor
blood making kinship to him, you took the
matter to council and accepted the hostage.
Are you sorry for it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this, which had been so little anticipated,
there went a murmur around the hollow as
of doubt not quite resolved. Several cried out
uncertain words which a ruffle of wind broke
and scattered. Prassade wagged his red beard,
shouting:</p>

<p class='c010'>“No! By the Friend!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then,” she went on, more at ease, I
thought, “as it was with Ravenutzi, so with
these. I saw trouble, and now I do not see
it; trouble that comes of keeping them, or
trouble of letting them go. That I cannot determine
for you. So I say now, if you do not
regret what you have done by Ravenutzi, do
the same with these, accept and hold them,
waiting for a sign.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She left off, and the moon came out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>cloud to discover how they stood toward it,
and went in again discovering nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then a man who had already pricked himself
upon my attention, stood up to argue the
matter. He was short and exceedingly stout
of build. Above the thick bands of leather
that protected his lower limbs, he wore no
dress but a cougar skin bound about the thick
columnar body and held in place by a cord
passing over the shoulder. He was armed
with a crotched stick that had an oblong
pointed stone bound in the crotch by thongs,
the handle of which was so long that, as he
stood with his hands, which were wide and
burned but shapely, resting upon it, the head
of the weapon lay upon the ground. What
was most singular in his appearance, as he
stood blocked solidly against the half-lit sky,
was his hair. It was pale yellow, crisp and
curling, and rayed out erectly from his head
as though it were the emanation of some natural
force or property of the man, curiously and
independently alive above the square and
somewhat meaningless regularity of his countenance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why,” inquired he, “were these House-Folk
brought here to Deep Fern? Why not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>made to drink forgetfulness when first taken?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Evarra had forgotten the Cup,” Persilope
explained; “she thought it could be gathered
at Broken Tree, but she had forgotten how
much further the season is advanced in that
neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But now,” said Evarra, “I have prepared
it, and there is nothing more to do.” She
came forward, and I observed that she held a
wooden bowl against her breast from which
steam arose, and an aromatic smell.</p>

<p class='c010'>The moon had risen early on the track of
the sun. The shallow lap of hills in which
we stood gave directly westward to the belated
glow that diffused through the moon shadows
an amber bloom, in which, though the faces
of the Outliers shone indistinctly, every motion
and purpose was discernible. I could see
then that Evarra’s purpose was to give Herman
and me to drink of some herb which
should cause us to forget all that had happened
to us since we had crossed their borders
at Broken Tree, and so send us home again.
It met with so much approval that I spoke
hurriedly to forestall it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no!” I cried. “We have done no harm
to you that you should do so great a harm to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>us. If you must send us away, why, send us,
and we will give you our word, and that is
the best thing we have to give, that no one
shall know of what has happened these four
days. But do not take away the recollection
from us.” I spoke so earnestly and meant so
much what I said, taking Herman’s hand so
as to include him in the vehemence of my
request, though I do not think he had any particular
feeling at the time, that I made some
way with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing is farther from our thoughts,” I
said, seeing Evarra hesitate, “than to bring
harm upon you. Not for the world would
we betray your ways nor your homes nor your
treasure——”</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not know why I should have mentioned
treasure, except that seeing old Noche’s flowing
head outlined against the pale luminosity
of the sky that instant, brought it to my mind.
The word popped out on my tongue as suddenly
as it had popped in. Instantly there was
a sharp crackling of exclamations and a stir
as of people rushing together when a brand
has snapped out of the fire, followed by a portentous
stillness. Into this bay of sound the
red-pointed beard of Prassade projected itself.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Who,” he cried, “has been telling of treasure
in the hearing of House-Folk?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No one, no one,” I protested, anxious not
to provoke blame; “it is only that I overheard
the children——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was I,” admitted Noche regretfully,
“old fool that I am. I was telling the children,
and I did not think she understood so
much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fool!” said Prassade; “and twice fool for
being an old one!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Persilope corrected him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At the time of the Wardship it is permitted
to tell the children of the King’s Desire
and the keeping of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But not in the presence of House-Folk,”
Prassade insisted, “nor by one who thinks there
is no harm in a jewel if only it shines well and
has a story to it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was more to this which the wind
broke and carried away, arms lifted and heads
cast up within the shadow, turbulence and
murmurs of denial. I heard Trastevera say,
half to herself:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Trouble come indeed, when one Outlier
calls another a fool in open council.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is nothing,” whispered Evarra at my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>shoulder, “all this talk. Though you had the
King’s Desire in your hand, yet you would stay
if Persilope thought she wished it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the yellow head of Mancha crinkled
in the circle of the fire, his face under it grotesquely
blocked with light, like some ancient
mask, crying:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Signs—do we wait for Signs? Here is a
Sign: first the woman comes, and then the man
seeking her. Now, if they are not returned
speedily to their own place who may not come
looking for the two of them? And if, being
kept, they escape by chance and go back talking
of treasure——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But a Sign!” cried Persilope, interrupting
him. “Outliers, here is a Sign. These House-Folk
have found us in a place where none of
their kind so much as mark our trails. Within
a day after being in our camp they have heard
of the King’s Desire, and talked openly of it.
This is a Sign that they are more favored by
the Friends of the Soul of Man than any of
their kind. Is it not a Sign?”</p>

<p class='c010'>We could see men rising to their feet here
and there, and some cried out: “A Sign! A
Sign!” And then other broken phrases, torn
and trumpeted by the wind. Persilope took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the bowl from Evarra, holding it out over the
fire with a motion to extinguish the dying
flame.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One has seen strangers coming, and strange
things have come; shall we not wait upon
her word?” he cried. I could make nothing
of the confused murmur which ringed the
hollow. Persilope must have read acquiescence
in it, for he partially emptied the contents
of the bowl upon the fire and then passed
it to Mancha, Ward of the Outer Borders, to
see what he would do. Mancha, smiling,
handed the cup to Trastevera as a sign of unbroken
confidence; she, as I guessed, so accepting
it. That was the last I saw of her before
Evarra hurried me away, holding high the
bowl, slowly pouring the ceremonial water,
silvered by the moon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE MEET AT LEAPING WATER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Within five days, during which
it rained and cleared, a fine
long growing rain that left the
world new washed and shining,
the Meet of the Outliers was moved to Leaping
Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the amphitheater of the terraced
basin lying next above Deep Fern, and took
its name from the long leap of the creek that
came flashing down arch by arch from the
high, treeless ridges. Five leaps it took from
Moon-Crest to the Basin, where it poured
guttering, in so steep a channel that the spray
of it made a veil that shook and billowed
with the force of its descending waters. It
trailed out on the wind that drove continually,
even on the stillest days, between the high
wings of the mountain, and took the light as
it traveled from east to west and played it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>through all its seven colored changes. It was
like a great pulse in the valley, the throb and
tremble of it, flushing and paling. The Basin
was clear meadow land, well-flowered, close
set by the creek, but opening well under the
redwoods, with here some sunny space of
shrubs, and there stretching up into the middle
region of white firs dozing on the steeps
above the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was here we began to learn about the
Love-Left Ward which was the occasion of
their coming together.</p>

<p class='c010'>The very first I heard of it was from Evarra’s
slim lad, Lianth, who, when he was sent to
keep me company, would lie on the fern, propping
his chin upon his hand, and sing to me
in his reedy unsexed voice, of a maiden who
had left loving for the sake of a great service
to her tribe. Then plucking up the brown
moss by the roots, examining it carefully, he
would ask me if I thought it was really right
for a girl to do that sort of thing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sort?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give up loving and all her friends, boys
she’s always—liked, you know, and keep a
Ward, like Zirriloë.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did she do that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Well, they chose her to be the Ward this
year, and her father let her. I don’t think he
ought!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Lianth was not very clear on this point, except
as it involved the masculine conception of
beauty as the sign of a real inward preciousness.
Zirriloë had a way of walking, like a
wind in a blooming meadow, she had a cheek
as soft, as richly colored, as the satin lining of
unripened fir cones which he broke open to
show me. <i>Therefore</i> Prassade shouldn’t have
let her forswear all loving for ten years.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She can’t even look at a boy,” said Lianth;
“only at old men, Noche and Waddyn and
Ravenutzi, and if there was—anybody—had
thought of marrying her, he’d have to give up
thinking about it for ten years. And anyway,
what is the good of giving a girl secrets to
keep if you have to watch her night and day
to see that she keeps them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a great deal more to this which
Herman learned from the men and the girl’s
father. Prassade, whose eldest child she was,
felt himself raised to immeasurable dignity by
the choice of Zirriloë, who was in fact all that
Lianth reported her, and more. To his pride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>it was a mere detail that during the ten years
of her Wardship she was to live apart from all
toward whom her heart moved her, kept by
old, seasoned men, who never left her except
with others older and less loverly than themselves.
These six months past she had been
with her watchers in a lonely place, learning
by trial what it meant to have left all love to
become the Ward of mysteries.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was there Trastevera had been when I
first saw her, to examine the girl and discover
if her mind was still steadfast.</p>

<p class='c010'>So she found it, and so reported it to Prassade,
and all things being satisfactory, the
feast of the Love-Left Ward was to take place
on the fifth day from this. When her term
was done the Ward took the Cup, and so forgetting
all she had heard, returned to the normal
use of women.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But,” I said to Lianth, once when we were
gathering elderberries by the creek, “what is
it all about, this secret which Zirriloë must
keep, and is not trusted in the keeping?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” he exclaimed impatiently, kicking at
the mossy stones in the water-bed. “Ask
Noche—he is one of the keepers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I should have taken that advice at once, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Noche was away at the Ledge, or River Ward,
or wherever the girl was, and Evarra was
much too busy to talk. Practically all the
Outliers were expected at Leaping Water, and
there was a great deal to do. As to how many
there were of them, and what places they came
from, I could never form any idea, since outside
of Council Hollow they never came together
in the open. At the fight at River
Ward there were forty picked men, slingsmen
and hammerers, but counting women and
children there must have been quite four times
that number at Leaping Water. They ran together
like quail in the wood, and at a word
melted like quail into its spacious silences.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was that subtle essence of rejuvenation
in the air that comes after rain. Buds
of the incense shrub were swelling and odorous.
All the forest was alive and astir with the
sense of invisible friendly presences and low-toned
happy talk that seemed forever at the
point, under cover of a ruffling wind or screening
rush of water, of breaking into laughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>We came often upon lovers walking in the
high arched aisles, children scuttling pink and
unabashed in the dappled water, or at noons,
men and women half sunk in the fern deep in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>gossip or dozing. Such times as these we began
to hear hints by which we tracked a historic
reality behind what I had already accepted
heartily, and Herman with grudging, the existence
of the King’s Desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>They would be lying, a dozen of them in
company on the brown redwood litter, the
towered trunks leaning to the firs far above
them. Then one would begin to sing softly to
himself a kind of rhymeless tune, all of dead
kings in a rock chamber canted in their thrones
by the weight of jewels, and another would
answer with a song about a lovely maid playing
in sea caves full of hollow light.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this we knew the thoughts of all of them
ran on the story which held the songs together
like a thread. We discovered at last that it
was the history of the place from which they
had come to Outland, bringing the Treasure
with them, pursued by the Far-Folk. Or perhaps
it was they who were the pursuers, but
the Treasure had been the point of their contention,
and it had cost the Outliers so much
that they had come to abhor even the possession
of it. So having buried it, they made
their honor the keeping of the secret. Because
the first disturbance over it that reft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>them from their country had been brought
about by the treachery of a woman, they put
a woman to the keeping, half in irony, I think,
for then they had set a watch upon the woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was about this time that Herman waked
to an interest on the occasion that nothing else
had been able to arouse in him. He thought
that a community which had arrived at the
pitch of understanding that the best thing to
be done with wealth was to get rid of it, would
repay study. I remember his wondering if the
Outliers had had any more trouble with their
Treasure, or what they imagined as such, for
he never would credit its reality, than we had
experienced with the Coal Oil Trust. I
paid very little attention to him, for all my
mind was occupied in watching Ravenutzi.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the first I had noticed that whenever
there was one of those old tales, or any talk of
the King’s Desire, something would spring up
in his face, as slight as the flick of an eyelid
or the ripple of muscles at the corner of
his mouth, but something at which caution
snapped wide-awake in me. I recall how once
we lay all together at the bottom of the wood
in the clear obscure of twilight, in a circular,
grassless space where the water went by with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>a trickling, absent sound. One of the young
men began to sing, and Ravenutzi had stopped
him with some remark to the effect that the
Outliers could sing it so if it pleased them,
but the story as it was sung was not true.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come,” said the youth, “I have always
wanted to know how the Far-Folk told that
part of the tale so as not to be ashamed of it.”
Prassade sprang up protesting that there
should be no communication between them
and the Hostage on a forbidden matter. Some
debate followed among the elders as to that.
I could see the smith sitting in his accustomed
attitude, knees doubled, hands clasped
about them, his chin resting on his knees. The
eyes were black in the twilight under the
faun’s profile and the streaked, springy hair,
yet always as if they had a separate furtive intelligence
of their own. It occurred to me
suddenly, that in this very debate precipitated
by Ravenutzi, the Outliers were talking about
the Treasure, and that he did not care in what
fashion so long as they talked. Instinctively
as I felt this, turning in my mind like a weed
in the surf, I looked toward Trastevera as one
turns in a dim room toward the light, holding
out my mind to her as to one of better sight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>I caught the eyes of Ravenutzi, the iris,
opaque and velvety, disappearing under the
widening pupil of his fixed gaze. I felt the
rushing suggestion back away from the shore
of my mind and leave it bare. There was
something I had meant to speak to Trastevera
about, and I had forgotten what it was.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was brought back to me the next day,
which was the one before the move to Leaping
Water. We were sitting in Evarra’s hut,
Herman and I, with Noche, for the wind and
cloud of the Council had contrived to blow up
a rain that drummed aloud on the bent fern
but scarcely reached us through the thick tent
of boughs. Above us we could hear the wind
where it went hunting like a great cat, but
down at the bottom of the pit of redwoods it
could scarcely lift the flap of the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>And without some such stir or movement
of life within, one might have passed a trail’s
breadth from the house of Evarra and not suspected
it, so skillfully was it contrived within
one of those sapling circles that spring up
around the decayed base of ancient redwoods,
like close-set, fluted columns round a ruined
altar. Every family had two or three such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>rooms, not connected, not close together, but
chosen with that wild instinct for unobtrusiveness
with which the Outliers cloaked the business
of living. From the middle of one of
these, smoke could go up through the deep
well of green and mingle undetected with the
blue haze of the forest. Deep within, tents of
skin could be drawn against the rain which
beat upon them with a slumberous sound and
dripped all down the shouldering colonnade.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tent was half drawn this morning, and
no drops reached us, but seldom, light spatterings
from high, wind-shaken boughs.
Evarra was abroad looking after her family,
and Noche had come over with Herman to
sit housed with me. The Outliers had, from
such indifferent observation as they had made,
got the notion that House-Folk were of great
fragility as regards weather. They were exceedingly
careful of us, though I had seen
Noche laugh as he shook the wet from his
body, and take the great gusts of wind as a
man might the moods of his mistress. He sat
opposite us now on a heap of fern, busy at his
sling-plaiting, with the placidity of a spinning
Hercules, and in a frame to be entertaining.
It occurred to me it might be an excellent time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>to beguile him into talk of the Treasure, much
to Herman’s annoyance, for he was of the
opinion that my having been a week among
the Outliers and no harm having come of it,
was no sign it wouldn’t come eventually.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t meddle with their tribal mysteries,”
he protested; “if it hadn’t been for their confounded
Treasure we would have been on the
trail for home by now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But consider,” I explained to Herman for
Noche’s sake; “if we drink Forgetfulness at
the last, what does it matter how much we
know before? And besides, he is suffering to
tell me. Go on, Noche.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Once you had old Noche started, his talk
ran on like the involute patterns he loved to
trace upon the sand, looping to let in some
shining circumstance or set off some jewel of
an incident. It was a wonderful treasure by
his account: lamps thick with garnets, crusted
with amethysts, and the cup of the Four Quarters
which a dead king held between his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>Outside we could hear the creaking of the
boughs as the wind pounced and wallowed,
stalking an invisible prey. Within the hut we
saw in the old man’s story, the summer island
from which the tale began, far southward, rising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>from the kissing seas. All at once he left
off, breathing quick, his nostrils lifted a little,
quivering, his head turning from side to side,
like a questing dog’s. We had heard nothing
but the trickle of rain down the corrugated
trunks, but Noche, turning his attention toward
the doorway, twitched his great eyebrows
once, and presently broke into smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Trastevera,” he said; and then a very curious
thing happened. Some patches of the
red and brown that had caught my attention
from time to time at the burl of the redwood
opposite stirred and resolved into Ravenutzi.
How long he had been there I had no notion.
Though I was well acquainted with that wild
faculty of the Outliers to make themselves
seem, by very stillness, part of the rock and
wood, I was startled by it quite as much on
this occasion as on the first time of my meeting
him. It was not as though Ravenutzi
made himself known to us by a movement,
but drew himself out of obscurity by the force
of his own thinking. The fact of his being
there seemed to shoulder out all question as to
why he was there in the first place. He was
looking, with that same curious fixity that
held me when I caught him dyeing his hair at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the spring, not at me, but at Trastevera approaching
on the trail. She came up the trail
in that lifting mood with which the well body
meets weather stress, as if her spirit were a
sail run up the mast to catch the wind. She
came lightly, dressed as the women mostly
were, in an under tunic of soft spun stuff, of
wood green or brown color, but her outer garment
was all of the breasts of water birds,
close-fitted, defining the figure. She looked
fairly back at Ravenutzi as she came, smiling
from below her quiet eyes. He walked on
past her so casually that only I could say that
he had not merely been passing as she passed.
But I was sure in my own mind he had been
sitting close by Evarra’s hut for a long time.</p>

<p class='c010'>She gave us Good Friending as she came
in, but it was not until Noche, in response to
a sign from her, had taken Herman out by the
brook trail, that she spoke to me directly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you made a promise to me in regard to
your being here and what you shall see among
us, would he, your friend, be bound by it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, in most particulars; at any rate, he
would give it consideration.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does he love you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” I said. I was sure of that much.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the best token in the world. He has
told me so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” She looked at me attentively a moment,
as if by that means she might discover
the reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then in that case he will probably do as
you say. If he loved you,” she smiled, “he
would expect you to do as he said.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She loosened her feather coat, shaking out
the wet, and took from Evarra’s wall an oblong
piece of cloth, brown and yellow barred
like the streakings of sunlight on the bark of
pines, and disposed it so that, with the folds
lying close and across the slender body and the
two loose ends falling over the shoulders, she
looked like some brooding moth that bides the
rain under a sheltering tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are so much more like us,” said she,
“than I would have expected; so much more
understanding. Have you Far-Seeing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How Far-Seeing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are some among us,” she said, considering,
“who can lie in their beds at night
and hear the deer crossing at Lower Fern;
some who can stand in their doors and see the
face of a man moving on the cliffs at Leaping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Water. But I am one who can see trouble
coming before the bearer of it has reached
Broken Tree. Have you such?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have heard of them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know then if they see better or
worse, for loving?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I could not tell her that, though I wished
to, since she made such a point of it. I had to
content myself with asking her how it was
with herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very much better,” she laughed, and colored;
“or worse.” She frowned, sighing. “I
will tell you how that is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I was just grown,” said Trastevera,
“I was chosen to be—to fulfill a certain duty
which falls every ten years to some young
woman of the tribe. It was a duty which kept
my heart occupied so that there was no time
for loving or being loved. I was much apart
and alone, and it was then that my Gift came
to me, the gift of Far-Seeing. It served the
tribe on many occasions, particularly on one
when we were at war with the Far-Folk. I
saw them breaking through at River Ward,
and again I saw them when they tried to get at
us from the direction of the sea——But it
was not of that I meant to tell you. After I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>was released from my duty I had planned because,
because——” She seemed to have the
greatest difficulty getting past this point,
which for so direct a personality as hers was
unusual. I gathered that the matter was involved
in the tribal mysteries which Herman
had warned me to avoid, so I could not help
her much with questioning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because of a certain distinction which they
paid me, I had planned,” she went on at last,
“to have no love and no interest but theirs.
It came as a shock to me when Persilope was
made Warden of the Council, to find that it
was agreed on every side that I should marry
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t you love him then?” I was curious
to know.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I scarcely knew him, but I knew what he
was, and if it was thought best for me to love
him, I wished, of course, to do what was best.
And Persilope wished it also.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You could do that? Love, I mean where
you were told to love.” Somehow the idea
filled me with a strange trepidation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the man was love worthy, why not?”
She was surprised in her turn. “So long as
my heart was not yet given, it was mine to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>where the Outliers would be best served by
it. Do you mean to say,” she asked, sensing
my incredulity, “that it is not so with the
House-Folk? Do you not also serve the tribe
most?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With our lives and our goods,” I admitted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But not with your loving? But if you love
only to yourselves, is not the common good
often in peril from it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Often and often,” I agreed. Suddenly it
began to seem a childish and ineffectual thing
that we should be in the most important issues
of life so at the mercy of place and incident,
obscuring coquetries and tricks of dress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sometimes it is so with us,” she agreed,
“but not with people like myself and Persilope.
When it was brought to our notice how
all the Outliers would be benefited by our
uniting his practical sense with my far-seeing,
we held our hearts out like a torch and lighted
each from each.” They could do that it
seemed, these Outliers, apt full natures, they
could rise in the full chord of being and love
without other inducement than the acknowledgment
of worth. That was why the Outliers
took no notice of what I was secretly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>ashamed of having noticed, that she was years
older than her husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaving the habits of the House-Folk,
Trastevera went on with her narrative.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have a custom when we are married,”
she said, “of choosing where it shall be. We
set forth, each from his own home, all our
friends being apprised of what we are about
to do and wishing us well. Then we come to
the place, each by his own trail, meeting there
under no eyes. When a month is done we go
home to our friends, who make a great to-do
for us. There is a hill I know, looking seaward,
a full day from here. There are pines
at the top and oaks about the foot, but the
whole of it is treeless, grassy, with flowers that
sleep by day among the grasses. It is neither
windy nor quiet, but small waves of air run
this way and that along the grass, and make
a changing pattern. Here I chose to meet
Persilope. All day I went down by Deer
Leap and River Ward to meet my man, and he
came up by Toyon and the hiving rocks to
meet me. All day I felt him come, and the
earth felt him: news of him came up through
the grasses and touched my finger-tips.” She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>flushed a little, and finished simply: “When
we came back,” she said, “I had reason to believe
I had lost the gift of Far-Seeing. It was
while we were away that the Far-Folk had
opened the matter of the hostage, and the
Council waited for Persilope to come back
from his wedding to decide what was best to
be done. The people were for the most part
glad to put an end to quarreling.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the first time that I realized that
there was another sort of woodlanders beside
the Outliers. Up till this time, when I had
heard mention of Far-Folk, I thought it perhaps
another sort of name for us, House
Livers, as they called us indifferently, or Diggers,
or They of the Ploughed Lands, as people
will speak of a wild species, very common
but of too little interest to be named or known.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So soon as I had heard of the Far-Folk’s
plan to send us their smith as a perpetual hostage,”
she went on, “I was chilled with prescience
of disaster, and said so freely. But
when Ravenutzi came to council, and I had
looked him through, I was warm again. You
heard how I said last night that I could not
tell if it was the blood of the Far-Folk playing
traitor in me, or if there was, in fact, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>shadow coming. So I was obliged to say to
the Council, and they on their own motion,
without any help from me, accepted him. No
one has blamed me”—she mused a little, with
her chin upon her hand—“but ever since I
have been afraid. There might really have
been some intimation of coming evil which
my happiness, going from me to everything I
looked upon, dispelled as a bubbling spring
breaks up a shadow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She rose and walked from me a little space,
returned, and stood before me so intent upon
getting some answer more than my words, that
I thought it best to let no words trouble her.
Presently she went on:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Since then I have had no serious forecasting
that concerned the Outliers at large.
But some days before Prassade first found you,
I had a vision of Broken Tree and a bird
rising from it crying trouble. There was
shadow lying on my world, and dread of loss
and change. But this is the strangest thing of
all. When I had seen you I saw more than
that. Between you and Ravenutzi there was
some bond and understanding.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no!” I protested; “on his part, yes,
some intention toward me, some power to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>draw me unaware to meet some end of his.
And yet....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And yet you like him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I admitted it. Though I had no special
confidence in his purpose, I felt my soul invite
his use.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And that,” said Trastevera, “is why I have
kept you here and advised that you be told
anything it is lawful for an Outlier to know.
Ordinarily when we find House-Folk among
us we give them the Cup and let them go.
But since you are to drink forgetfulness at last,
before that happens you may be of use to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Though I had more curiosity than concern,
I could see doubt pulsing in her like the light
breathing of a moth. She resolved at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Even if you betray me, there is still the
Cup,” she said. “You have already been of
use to me, for as I came into camp last night
I felt the shadow; it was not on you when I
looked, but when Ravenutzi looked at you I
saw it fall, and it fell from him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She considered me attentively to see what
I would make of this, but not willing to say
until I had considered it myself, I spoke of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the Cup; beginning to take it seriously for the
first time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of what,” said I, “will it make me forgetful?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Everything at first, but by degrees the past
will clear. Only around all that happens here,
and around the circumstance of your drinking
it, there will be the blank of perfect sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why are you so sure in sparing me,
that I shall be able to serve you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How could you help it?” She looked at
me in quick surprise. “You are not like your
friend is who says this is good or not good, and
that is the end of it. You are one in whom the
vision clouds and colors. By the color of your
mind when it falls under Ravenutzi’s I shall
learn perhaps whether to trust my old distrust
of him or my present friendliness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” she cried, perceiving so readily at
that instant the half conviction, half credulity,
of my mind toward her that she was embarrassed
by it. “Is it so among House-Folk that
they must always explain and account for
themselves? If I said to an Outlier that he
could help me he would not have questioned
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what am I to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Hold the will to help me. Be friends with
the smith if he is friendly, and say nothing of
this to any one but me. When your time
comes to take the Cup I will see that it is
made light for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It did not sound very difficult, and perhaps
I did not take it very seriously; at any rate I
gave the promise. Trastevera unwinding herself
from the striped cloth like a moth coming
out of a chrysalis, resumed her feather coat
and left me with that suddenness I had learned
to expect of the Outliers, like a bird flitting
or a weasel slipping in the chaparral.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the very first occasion of our being alone
together after that I demanded of Evarra
what Trastevera had meant by saying that she
was of the blood of Ravenutzi, and that the
blood was traitorous. I could ask that safely,
because I had learned that, except in the one
important matter of the Treasure, the Outliers
had no skill in concealments and no knowledge
whatever of indirection. It was as if
somewhere in their history they had so sickened
of the stuff of treachery that their teeth
were set on edge at the mere attitudes of it,
tricks, pretensions and evasions.</p>

<p class='c010'>So I knew that if I opened a forbidden matter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Evarra would tell me so flatly, and that
would be the end of it. And if it was permissible
to speak at all, she would do me no
such discourtesy as not to speak freely.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a very old affair, she said, but one
well known among the Outliers. In one of
their quarrels with the Far-Folk one of their
own women was taken and kept. Afterward she
had been returned to her home by purchase,
and had had a child shortly after, begotten
upon her unwillingly by one of the Far-Folk.
From that child Trastevera was descended.
The blood of the Far-Folk, said Evarra, was
a foul strain, but they had mixed it with the
best of theirs, and there was no more treason
left in it than there was soiling of last season’s
rains in the spring that watered Deep Fern.
None of the Outliers had even remembered
it until Ravenutzi came. As for these Far-Folk,
they were to the Outliers all that cat
was to dog, hill-dwellers, seeking treeless
spaces, holes in the rock and huts of brush;
wiry folk, mocking and untruthful. But they
were such inveterate craftsmen that a man of
them could sooner smudge himself at a forge
making a knife to trade you for a haunch of
venison, than go a-hunting for his meat himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>It was so most of the iron implements I
had noticed had been circulated among the
Outliers. For their part they preferred casting
themselves joyously forth on the day to
come back well furnished by their own hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>But a man of the Far-Folk would sit all day
with his nose to a bit of hammered metal,
graving on it strange patterns of beasts and
whorls and lacing circles. When it was done,
said Evarra, there was no great pleasure in
it, for it would not glitter as a bit of shell, nor
brown nor brighten as a string of berries, nor
be cast every hour in a new pattern like a chaplet
of flowers, but remained set forever, as the
Far-Folk in their unkempt ways.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were piliferous too, and lived in such
relation as weasels might to the people of the
Ploughed Lands; by which term she always
spoke of the few farmers whose homesteads
I could occasionally see from Outland. The
Far-Folk would go down by night across the
borders of the Outliers to the farmyards for
their scraps of metal, and ate fruit from the
orchards. It was to purchase free passage for
such expeditions through disputed territory
that they had given hostage to their foes at
Deep Fern; free leave to go and come from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Deer Leap to the River Ward, and between
Toyon and Broken Head. Up to this time the
compact had been scrupulously kept, though
it was evident from Evarra’s manner of admitting
it, she begrudged any good opinion I
might have of the Far-Folk on that account.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what harm have you had from Ravenutzi?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ah, that was as might be, if you counted the
failure of Trastevera’s visions and his making
a fool of old Noche with his smith’s tricks.
The old man had thought of little this year
past but forge work and designs—and prating
to the children of the King’s Desire. “If it
had been my child listening to him,” finished
Evarra, “I should have smacked him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All of which I told to Herman at the first
opportunity. And also that I should never
be happy one moment until I had found out
what fact, if any, lay behind the story of the
King’s Desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the good of finding out,” said Herman
gloomily, “if we have to take their everlasting
dope on top of it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And within three days of the most sophisticated
society on earth,” I reminded him.
“They are having the golf tournament at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Mira Monte this week. Could you believe
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I don’t believe a word of it,” he insisted.
“This is just one of the tales you’ve
made up, and you’ve hypnotized me into going
through with it, but I don’t believe it at all.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>V<br /> <span class='large'>THE LOVE-LEFT WARD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>I was sitting under a toyon tree watching
Evarra brew forgetfulness in a polished
porphyry bowl, when Herman
came by. It was the morning of the
Meet. The Cup was wanted for her who was
the Ward, and Evarra took a great deal of
pains with the brew, heating the bowl slowly
and, when the dry leaves began to smoke and
give off an odor of young fir, dropping water
gently and setting it to steep in the sun. I had
hoped to discover what plant it might be, but
there was little to be guessed except that it
had a blue flower taken in the bud, and smelled
like a wood path in the spring. Evarra sat
and stirred under the toyon and answered my
questions or not as she was inclined.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know any sort of an herb, Evarra,
that will turn gray hair black again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That I do; and black hair gray if you wish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>it.” But I had not caught the significance of
her statement, when Herman came along,
bursting full of news. He was looking almost
handsome that morning, for he had put on the
dress of the Outliers for the first time, and
though he had managed it so as to cover more
of his skin than was their fashion, it became
him very well. Some satisfying quality
streamed from him, according with the day.
As if he had laid off something besides the
dress which had come between him and the
effect I had wished him to have on me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come up the trail with me; I have some
news for you,” he began. “May she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>This last was to Evarra. With all the basin
of Deep Fern and Leaping Water full of their
own folk we had been allowed to move freely
about among them, but there was still a form
of keeping us under guard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go up,” said Evarra, probably glad to get
rid of me, “as far as Fallen Tree, where you
can see the Leap between that and the clearing.
I will join you presently. You can see
the procession best from there, when it first
comes out of the wood.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The dew was not yet gone up from the
shadows nor the virgin morning warmed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>whit toward noon; the creek sang at the curve,
I felt the axles of the earth sing as it swung
eastward. I spread out my arms in the trail
and touched the tips of the growing things,
and felt the tide of abundant life rise through
my fingers. Herman strode in the trail ahead
and called over his shoulder:</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you laughing at back there,
Mona?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“News,” I answered, for I had remembered
suddenly something Trastevera had said to
me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What news?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How should I know, except that it is good
news? The meadowsweet told it to me.
What’s yours?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That Treasure you’re so keen about;
they’ve really got it. I’ve talked with men
who’ve seen it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Noche?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He hasn’t come back yet, but Waddyn, one
of the keepers—there were four of them—dug
it up ten years ago and reburied it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s my news. On account of Trastevera.
She was the Ward ten years ago, and
they were afraid to give her their wretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>drug lest they should destroy her gift of Far-Seeing,
as they call it. So they took counsel
and decided to change the hiding-place. Prassade
said it wasn’t an altogether popular movement.
Some of the Wards haven’t taken kindly
to the Cup when their turn came, and they
feared the precedent. But anyway they did it.
They made a cordon round the place where
it was hid, three days’ journeys wide, and the
four old men went in and dug up the Treasure
and buried it again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All those jewels and beaten gold?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whatever it is they’ve got, colored pebbles
most likely. It wouldn’t have been so bad,
Prassade says, changing the place of the
Treasure; that has happened several times in
their history. But while they had it up they
had a look at it, and Noche’s head has been
turned ever since.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think it might. It’s all true,
then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Folk tales, likely; all tribes have them.”
Though his face was turned from me on the
trail, I could feel Herman’s professional manner
coming on again. “It is extraordinary,
though, how their social organization is so
nearly like to what you would expect of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>highly civilized people thrown suddenly back
on the primal environment. Take their notions
of property now——”</p>

<p class='c010'>What he was going to say must have been
very interesting, but just at this point we came
to Fallen Tree, and saw the irised banner of
the Leap floating before its resounding crash
of waters. A little spit of grassy land ran here
from the clearing into the dense growth, and
the trail entered by it. Beyond it, pale late
lilies censed the shadows of the redwoods, and
below in the meadow there was nothing fairer
than the bleached, wind-blown hair of the
children, as they ran and shouted through the
scrub. Evarra came hurrying with the Cup
against her breast. Prassade and Persilope
took up a station of some prominence on the
point opposite us, with Mancha behind them,
leaning on his long weapon. Presently the
flutes began.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sound of them stole upon us softly
from far within the redwoods, keyed a little
under the bell tones of the creek, and rising
through it to the pitch at which the water note
seems forever at the point of breaking into
speech. As the procession skirted the meadow,
the music emerged in a tune fetching and human.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Now you heard the swing of blossoms
by runnels in the sod, the beat of spray on
the bent leaves by the water borders; then
the melody curling and uncurling like the
ringlets on a girl’s neck. With the music some
sort of pageant passed, boys and girls wreathed
and dancing, forming as they wound in the
wood glooms, breaking and dissolving where
the trail led through the bright, sunned space
of the meadow. We could hear from the Outliers
ranged about the clearing, light applause
of laughter like the patter that follows the
wind in the quaking asp.</p>

<p class='c010'>The pageant circled the open space around
which rippled the curved blade of the creek,
and came to halt behind Persilope and the
Council. Then a drum-beat arose and rolled
steadily, the four keepers came out of the
wood; Noche and Waddyn and two others I
did not know or observe, except that they were
not young and carried the occasion solemnly.
The keepers took up their station on either
side of the meadow, and the two foremost, saluting,
passed on a little beyond the chief.
Into the hollow square thus formed for her,
came the maiden Ward.</p>

<p class='c010'>First as she stood there, one realized in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>figure the springing pose of immaturity, in her
gaze the wraptness and fixity of the devotee.
Altogether she was of so exquisite a finish and
delicacy that one would wish to have plucked
her like a flower. She was dressed in a smooth,
seamless bodice of tawny skin, baring the
throat and rounded upper arm; below that a
skirt of thin green was shaped to her young
curves by the vagrant wind. Her hair, which
was all of burnt gold, powdered with ashes
of gold, was drawn loosely back and confined
close to her head, but fell free to her hips,
blown forward, defining her like the sheath of
a flower. Her brows also were touched with
gold and the eyes under her brows were like
agate at the bottom of a brook.</p>

<p class='c010'>She wore no jewels but a thread of scarlet
berries that, in its revealing femininity, in the
way it took the curve of her slender throat and
ran into the little hollow between her breasts,
so seemed to me as if I had never seen a more
endearing ornament. As she appeared among
us,—for though she had walked very quietly
out of the forest there was that appealing quality
of her loveliness which gave to her coming
the swiftness of a vision,—as she appeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>thus, a ring of smiling ran sensibly about the
hushed, observing circle.</p>

<p class='c010'>She moved in the exultation of her shining
mood, unconscious of the way her feet went
or what eyes were upon her, to the sound of
the shallow drums and the delicate high flutes.
As the music dropped she stopped before Persilope,
who stood forward a little with some
formal words of ritual or salutation. I missed
the exact words, all my attention taken up
with what had happened to Mancha. He
had been standing just behind the chief, and
in the brief interval while Zirriloë had come
ten steps or so out of the shadow, he had
passed, as though her beauty had been some
swift, vivifying shock, from being a grave beholder
to an active participant of the occasion.
Deep red surged up in his face and left
it pale again, his eyes, which were blue,
burned amber points and took her like a flame.
He shook as though the joints of his spirit
were loosed, and took the full red under-lip
in his teeth to keep back the tide of strength
that came on him as he looked at her. His
breath came purringly. I saw the soul of the
man lithe and rippling in him, the glint of
his eyes, the mass and thickness of his body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>incredibly lifted and lightened by the consciousness
of the Mate. He did not know
what had happened to him, but he laughed
to himself his joy in her, as she moved
wrapped in her high errand down the still
summer glade, and across the meadow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Herman! Herman! Do you see?” I whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was sitting on the fallen tree next to me,
and as I moved my hand toward him in that
vague pang following quick on the shock of
inexpressible beauty, I felt his fingers cold.
His lips were open and I saw his tongue move
to wet them, like a man unconsciously athirst.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond the clearing, thick purplish trunks
of the redwood upbore the masses of foliage
like a cloud. The space between the first
twenty feet or so of their gigantic columns
was choked with laurel and holly and ceanothus,
pierced by long tunnels that the deer had
made. Down one of these the two foremost of
the keepers plunged and were lost behind the
mask of loose, wild vines that festooned the
front of the wood, lifting and falling in the
wind that by mid-morning began to set seaward
from the high ridges.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the girl, some ten steps behind them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>still in her half-seeing mood, missed the moment
of the out-streaming of the vines,
checked and faltered. The wind caught her
dress and wrapped her in it, the drapery of
vines swung out and caught her hair. Before
the other keepers could come up with her, the
long arm of Ravenutzi reached out from his
point of vantage on a heavy, slanting trunk
and gathered up the offending vines, holding
them high and guardedly until the girl could
pass. The detention was slight, but long
enough for the annoyance of it to have pierced
her abstraction before he let the curtain fall
almost on the heads of the hurrying keepers,
long enough for her to have looked up at
Ravenutzi and accord to him the first conscious
recognition of her solemn passage.
Whatever flattery there might have been in
that, it could not draw so much as a backward
glance from him. With the swish of
the long vines flung back upon the wall of
boughs, he sprang forward from his perch,
and as if that action had been the signal, drew
with him a ring of staring faces toward the
grassy spit by which the trail entered the
meadow.</p>

<p class='c010'>The music, which during the ritual had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>melted into the undertone of forest sounds,
emerged again more pointedly human and
appealing. It summoned from the bluish
glooms an interest so personal and touching
that it drew the Outliers from the shy wildness
of their ways. The ring of watchers surged
forward a step, the music rose like a sigh of
expectation and ushered in a group of women
who, without any order or solemnity, but with
a great and serious kindness, supported a
young woman in their midst. It was she who
had been the Ward and was now to receive
forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as I saw Trastevera, upon whose
arm she leaned, I understood that these were
the former Wards, come to afford her such
comfort as their experience justified. It was
not until I saw her mother hurry forward crying:
“Daria! Daria!” that I began to realize
what need of comfort there must be. Evarra
beside me stirred the Cup. Its faint aromatic
odor was of a cold and sickly dread, reflected
from Daria’s widened eyes on some secret surface
of myself.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was a pretty girl, warm-tinted, eyes of
a wet gray, the broad brow and sensitive short
lip of women whose happiness centers in approval.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>It was easy to read in her face that
of all the restrictions of her Wardship the one
against loving had been hardest borne; plain
to be seen now in the way she clung to her
mother, who took the face between her hands,
that of all the forfeitures that lay in the blue
flower of forgetfulness, that one of loving was
most difficult to pay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“O mother, mother,” she said, “I cannot
bear it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She shuddered sick, looking on all she had
lived among and knowing that she might
never know them again with that one of herselves
which stood hesitating between the
meadow and the wood. There was not one of
all those trails, if she set foot in it to-morrow,
that she would know where it went or what
she might meet in it. She was to die in effect,
to leave life and memory, to wake mutilated
in the midst of full-blooded womanhood, without
childhood, girlhood, parents, intimates.</p>

<p class='c010'>“O mother,” she said, “I cannot bear it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She clung crying to her mother’s hand,
while the other women crowded comfort upon
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, Daria,” one assured her, “but I
knew my mother. There were four others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>with me when I woke, but I knew her. I did
not know what she was to me, nor any name
to call her, but my heart chose her from
among the rest, and I held out my arms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They said many more things to this purport,
while the girl turned her face to her mother’s
bosom as though she admitted all this, but it
did not touch her case.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then her father, coming forward, distressed
for her, but somewhat more concerned for
the situation, taking her by the shoulders, recalled
her to herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Daughter,” he said, “have you carried the
honor of the Outliers so many years to fail
us at the last? How do you make life worth
remembering with broken faith? And who
will respect you if you respect not your
word?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She cleared a little at that and recovered, so
that she was able to go through with some dignity
the farewells which the elders now came
forward to bestow with fixed cheerfulness.
Then came her young companions, saying,
“We have nothing ill to remember of you,
Daria,” and “Good-waking, Daria.” She
broke out again, desperate rather than despairing.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“Do not say so to me, I shall not drink it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall not?” It was Persilope taking the
Cup from Evarra, and moving forward as he
spoke. “It is a word that has never been heard
before from a Ward.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Quick red leaped in Daria’s face, which she
turned this way and that, searching the
meadow for some prop to her determination.
It seemed that she found it, though there was
nothing I could read there but commiseration
and disapproval.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall not,” she breathed; and then quite
low, sweeping his countenance once with her
glance, and then fixing it steadily on the
ground. “<i>She</i> did not drink it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The emphasis was slight, slighter than the
flicker of her eyes toward Trastevera, but the
impact of her meaning drove the chief’s wife
from her. One scarcely saw Trastevera move,
but there was now a rift between the two
women, which widened with the shocked perception
in the listening circle. Persilope’s recovery
was instant, some sternness with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What had been done,” he said, “was done
by all the Council with good reason. But what
reason is here beyond a girl’s protesting
fancy?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Again Daria’s mutinous eyes searched the
meadow, and her resistance rose visibly in advance
of its support.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Reason enough!” The group of young
persons at the foot of the circle turned upon
itself, and released the figure of a young man
about thirty, tall and personable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have reason”—his voice shook, as though
the words had been too long repressed in him
and escaped bubblingly—“the best of reasons,
for I&nbsp;... we love....”</p>

<p class='c010'>He had hesitated an instant over the admission,
wanting some quick assurance which
flashed between the girl and him. Instantly
it brought from the women, in whose care and
keeping she had chiefly been, quick cries of
protest and denial, falling almost on the stroke
of his declaration.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you”—Persilope voiced the general
knowledge—“you have been these three years
at River Ward, you have not seen her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not for three years,” admitted the lover,
“for as soon as I knew that I loved her I went
away, that I might keep her honor and mine.”
His thought worked uneasily, but he went on.
“I have always loved her, but I had not told
her so when it came my turn to serve with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Mancha, and while I was away you chose her
to be the Ward. I went back and served my
time. When I returned to Deep Fern I saw
her walking with the women in the cool of
the morning and knew that I loved her. That
was the year the water came down from Water
Gate and tore up the valley. In the flood I
carried her——”</p>

<p class='c010'>He smiled; the inexpressible joyousness of
the woodlander broke upward in the remembrance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The next day,” he said, “she sent me word
to go back to River Ward, and I knew by
that that she loved me. So I went, and by
the evidence of the work I have done <i>you</i>
know how I have loved her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the evidence of the faith I have kept,”
said Daria, “you know how I have loved him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All this time I could see the faces of the
men, especially of the girl’s father and of Prassade,
growing sterner. Trastevera looked
down, studying the pattern of the meadow
grass. Persilope bit his lip in the midst, with
the Cup in his hand, and the lover grew
bolder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is love so cheap a thing to you, Persilope,
that you take it from us before we have tasted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>it? It is Daria I love as she is, as I have seen
her grow from a child into a woman, not a
stranger, looking at me with unremembering
eyes. Let the men take up the Treasure and
bury it again, as they did for Trastevera.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There was a reason,” the chief began, and
stopped, as if he knew that to argue was to
lose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, a reason——” I do not know by what
imperceptible degrees and mutual consentings
the lovers had got across the open space to
each other, but there they were, handfast,
confronting him. “Reason you thought you
had, but what good came of all your reasons
seeing that Trastevera has lost the Far-Seeing
for the sake of which she was excused from
the Cup. Let them bury the Treasure again—or
give it to the Far-Folk, for all I care,
since nothing comes of it but wars and forgettings.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He caught the girl to him fiercely as he
spoke, irritated by the hardening of the elders’
minds against that very touch of wildness and
rebellion by which he urged the disregard of
custom. Whatever advantage he had with
Persilope because of the precedent, he had lost
by the hint of its insufficiency.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“If,” said the chief, holding the bowl before
him, “there had arisen any occasion, which I
do not allow: <i>if</i> there had arisen such an occasion
for doubting the wisdom of our former
breach, it would be greater cause for our not
admitting it now. Do you propose”—forestalling
the rising thought—“to bring it to
Council? Look around you and see that we
who make the Council are already agreed.”
The eyes of the young couple traveled about
the group, they saw regret, but no relenting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If she forgets you,” said the chief more
kindly, “she forgets also the pain of her forgetting,
and you shall teach her to love again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Girl,” said her father, “if you shame me
there is no forgetfulness deep enough for
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I suppose that the mere acknowledgment
of their love had eased the tension of dread,
had waked, perhaps, that foolish human certainty
of passion to survive the loss even of its
own identity. Perhaps they had never had
any real hope of avoiding the issue; insensibly,
too, as the matter had increased in gravity,
the young listeners had melted from the circle,
leaving a ring of older, sterner faces, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>which they felt their resolution fail. We saw
the girl turn piteously in her lover’s arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You,” she said, “at least will not forget
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will not forget.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“See,” Persilope smiled faintly, and shaking
a little of the pale green liquid from the
bowl, “I have made it light for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl kept her eyes on the young man.
“And I am yours,” she urged; “whether or not
I remember, I am yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Knowing or unknowing,” the young lover
assured, “I call these to witness that you are
mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Daria put out her hand and took the bowl
from Persilope, but her lover put his hand
upon it over hers, holding it back until he
charged her soul again.</p>

<p class='c010'>She lifted the Cup and shuddered as she
drank; once she faltered, but he pressed it
firmly to her lips. No one moved in the listening
circle. The wind was busy with the
forest boughs; we saw the redwoods bend and
the curdling of the water at the falls. We saw
Daria’s head bowing on its slender stalk, like
the wild white columbine which the wind
shook behind her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“You will remember,” still her lover
warned her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will remember.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She drooped, all her body lax with sleep,
but still he propped her on his bosom. Her
mother took up the girl’s flaccid hand in hers
and fondled it softly; she did not urge her
claim.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Daria, Daria,” pleaded the lover, “say you
will remember.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She could not answer now except by the
turning of her head upon his bosom; color,
drained away by the drug, forsook her, the
lips were open and a little drawn. He would
have gathered her up then, but a motion from
the elders stayed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Remember, oh remember,” he called upon
her soul, and the soul struggled to reassure
him, but it lay too deep under Forgetfulness.
With a shudder she seemed almost to cease to
breathe. Evarra, stepping softly, lifted the
relaxed lids and showed the eyes rolled upward,
the pupils widened. She made a sign
at which the circle parted and made way for
the youth down the green aisles through which
he bore her to his house.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>VI<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH I AM UNHAPPY AND MEET A TALL WOMAN IN THE WOOD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>When the vines dropped back
from Ravenutzi’s hand upon the
wall of boughs through which
the Ward and her Keepers
passed, it was as if the step that carried them
out of sight of the Outliers had also carried
them out of knowledge. Not an eye that
any other eye could discover, nor any inquiring
word strayed upon their vanished
trail. In the three days before they returned
to the Meet, or it was proper to mention them,
they would have visited the King’s Desire, and
Zirriloë would be informed of everything pertinent
to that connection.</p>

<p class='c010'>During these three days no Outlier concerned
himself with their whereabouts lest
he should be thought to have some concern
about the Treasure. With the exception of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Noche, I believe no Outlier had even so much
as curiosity about it. It had been so long since
any man had seen it, that until Noche’s account
of what the cache contained began to
be current, I think they had not any clear idea
what the Treasure might consist in. It was
something that the Far-Folk wanted and the
Outliers did not mean they should get. The
struggle kept alive in them tribal integrity and
the relish for supremacy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The practice of not speaking of the Treasure
during the three days’ absence of the
Ward, had taken on a rigidity of custom which
Herman and I did not feel ourselves bound
to observe. We could talk of the Treasure
and of Zirriloë, and we did that same morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the shadows were gathered close under
the forest border, and even to our accustomed
eyes there was no sign of the Outliers,
other than the subdued sense of gladsome life
spread on the pleasant air, I found a place
I knew. There the creek went close about the
roots of the pine between shallow sandy shoals,
and there Herman came to talk to me of the
Love-Left Ward. As he sat there at my feet
pitching stones into the shallows, that effulgence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of personality which had streamed from
him at the opening of that day, and now suffused
his manner with an unaccustomed
warmth, lay quite beyond my reach.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the dread with which Daria had
met the obliteration of memory and identity,
moved me to draw from Herman an assurance
that nothing could quite wipe out from him
all recollection of the fellowship and the good
times we had had together. It began to appear
an alarming contingency that I should
be turned out at any moment in a strange country
to find my way back to life in company
with a man I did not know and whose disposition
toward me was still to be learned. It
would have become Herman to be very nice
to me at this juncture, and while I sat feeling
blankly for the communicating thread, he began
to talk of the Ward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some of the women should have gone with
her,” he said; “somebody interested in her.
It’s all stiff chaparral from here to the ridge.
The girl will never stand it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t really know where they have
gone,” I hinted, “and Daria doesn’t seem to
have suffered.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Daria! But this girl needs looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>after. You can see that it means a lot to her,
losing—everything. She would have appreciated—things.
That string of red berries now—she
would have done justice to rubies.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The great necklace of red stones? Well,
she probably knows where they are by this
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A lot better use for them than keeping
them in a hole in the ground,” Herman insisted,
“especially when it costs the youth of
a girl like that to keep them there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know at least one Outlier who will agree
with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mancha.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he say that? What makes you think
so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I have often wondered why having gone so
far I did not go further and tell Herman
frankly what I thought I had discovered of
Mancha’s state of mind. I have wondered
oftener, if I had spoken then, if anything
would have come of it different or less grievous
than what did come. Whatever prevented
me, I answered only that he seemed
to me a man less bound by custom and superstition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>than his fellows, and Herman agreed
with me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I can tell you,” he said, “that Zirriloë
wouldn’t hear of it. You can just see how
her whole soul is bound up in the keeping of
her vows. She could be true as death to—anybody.”
He went on to say how he derived this
assurance from the way the sun-touched color
of her cheek spread into the whiteness of her
neck, and from the blueness of the vein that
ran along her wrist, and her springy walk. He
ran on in this fashion taking my agreement
very much for granted. What I really had
thought was that in spite of her beauty and
wraptness, the girl had rather a shallow face
and would be as likely to be as much engrossed
and as sure of herself in any other circumstances.
And I was so much disappointed at
Herman’s extraordinary failure of perception
that I could not allow myself to say anything
about it. I felt that a personal note must unreasonably
attach to any woman’s attempt to
show that a more beautiful one is not necessarily
a woman of more personal fineness. I was
so irritated with myself for being irritated
that I was glad to hear Evarra calling down
by the willows, and to leave Herman pitching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>pebbles into the shallows. Though it turned
out that Evarra was asleep under a madroño
and nobody had called me.</p>

<p class='c010'>During those three days while the Ward
and the keepers were away, there was a great
deal going on in the fenced meadows and by
Deer Lake and at the bottom of deep wells of
shade in the damp cañons. It was a broken,
flying festival, no two events of which took
place successively in the same quarter, for the
Outliers wished not to occupy ground long
enough to leave upon it any mark of use by
which House-Folk might suspect their presence.
The great events of the Meet went on
in so many places that nobody ever saw the
whole of them. That was why I had no more
talk with Herman and saw him but once or
twice until Zirriloë came back again. I heard
of him, though, and that in a manner and matter
that surprised me very much.</p>

<p class='c010'>The morning of the second day I went up
with the girls to race in Leaping Water. We
left the Middle Basin by a trail that took the
side of the hill abruptly and brought us out
at the foot of the second fall, above the long
white torrent of the Reach. They meant to
come down with the stream to the meadow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>again, and the game went to the one who was
least out of water in that passage. I followed
the windings of the creek as near as the undergrowth
allowed and heard their laughter, now
louder and now less than the water noises, and
saw between the trees the flash of foam change
to the glancing of white limbs, and the flicker
of the sun on fair bodies as they drifted
through the shallows. They took the falls feet
foremost, curving to its flying arch, white arms
wreathed backwards and wet hair blowing
with the spray. The swimmers so mixed themselves
with the movement of the water and the
well-sunned, spacious day, that they seemed no
more apart from it than the rush of the creek
or the flicker of light on leaf surfaces displaced
by the wind. They were no more obtrusive
than that mysterious sense of presence
out of which men derive gods and the innumerable
fairy host.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had walked thus in that awakened recognition
of sentience in the wild, in which all
Outland had become a dream which hunts
along the drowsy edge of sleep. I had continued
in it for perhaps half an hour, in such
a state that though I had no idea where we
were on the map, I believe I could have set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>out suddenly in the right quarter for home. I
had not heard my name pronounced, but I
began to be aware within myself that some
one had called. I was so sure of it that,
though I had no intimation yet of any presence,
I began to look about. After a little
trouble I made out Trastevera on the opposite
bank, between the willows, making signs that
she wished to speak to me, and yet enjoining
silence. The creek widened here and the girls
were coming down, following like trout. I
saw her press back among the swinging boughs
as they went by, and guessed that something
more than the ordinary occasion of the day
was astir. Presently, when we heard from below
the splash of laughter as the swimmers
struck the rapids, she came across to me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where were you yesterday when Daria
took the Cup?” she asked immediately.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Fallen Tree, not twenty steps from you—but
you were so taken up with that affair
that you did not see me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You heard, then, what her young man
said about”—she flushed sensitively—“his reasons
for her not drinking. Have you heard
anything of that in the Meet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing that need disquiet you.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>This was not strictly true, for Evarra had
told me that all those who had opposed Trastevera’s
exemption ten years before were now
justifying themselves in Daria’s rebellion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are saying what I feared,” she said,
“that it is a mistake to release the possessor
of gifts from the common obligation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are wrong, then, for nothing has
come of it but the momentary outburst of a
sensitive spirit. After all, Daria fulfilled her
vows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She looked at me curiously for a moment,
as if she were not sure what to make of me.
We were walking up and down behind the
trees, her dress a-flutter, her small hands clasping
and unclasping, her body rippling with
the expressive accompaniment of excitement
which was as natural to her as the unstrained
stillness of repose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you not think it wrong,” she said,
“when the findings of the Council are scorned,
and I—even I—make secret occasion to talk
of forbidden things?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She wheeled upon me suddenly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“And this plan which is hatched between
your man and Mancha, perhaps you see no
wrong in that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>She was too guileless herself to have taken
that method on purpose, but I felt my spirit
curling like a dried leaf out of all proportion
to her news. I managed to answer steadily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is not my man.” It did not occur to
me until afterward that it would have been
a surer form of denial not to acknowledge so
readily what man. “And as for any plans he
may have with Mancha or any other, I do not
know what they are. Nor would I be interested
except that I see it troubles you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All the time I was resenting unreasonably
that Herman should have any plans with anybody
and not broach them first to me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know very well what it is myself,”
she said more quietly, “except that it
grows out of this unhappy episode of Daria’s.
It must refer to the Wardship, because it is
rumored about that the Meet, instead of breaking
up on the evening when the keepers come
back, will hold over another day for Council.
That must be because they wish to talk of
matters that may not be opened earlier. It is
Mancha, I think, who wishes it. When some
of the elders reproved Daria’s lover for having
allowed himself to love a Ward, and for
speaking so lightly of the Keeping, Mancha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>said that a man could not help where his heart
went, and that there was too much truth in
what the young man said. Myself, I cannot
account for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can,” I said, “and though you might not
feel at liberty to question me, I at least may
tell you that it has to do with the Ward. He
is in love with her.” And I told her all that
I had seen or surmised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And your friend?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not knowing what his plan is, I cannot
give his reasons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” she said for all answer, and we
walked on without saying anything further
until I asked her what had become of Daria.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone on her wedding month; they went
away this morning as soon as she was fully
recovered, having seen no one. They went out
by Singing Ford. And even in that,” she
added, “there is something to criticize, for
it is not customary for any one to go away
from the Meet while the Keepers are abroad.
Oh,” she cried, striking suddenly upon her
breast, “it is through me, through me, that
all this breaking of custom comes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you care so much? All customs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>pass and in the end are replaced by better
ones.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that is not so,” she said, “if it is not so,
Daria’s lover was right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She walked a little from me and bit her
hands, as though she would have eaten down
the mortification of one who sees harm come
through what is best in him. Having recovered
herself a little came to ask me when I
had last seen Ravenutzi, and if I had observed
anything unusual in him. I had not, and naturally
wished to know if she had.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The shadow,” she said, “the long shadow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has it come again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It lies at his feet, it stretches behind him
and blots out the good day, it runs before him
and covers the Outliers when they sit happy
and at ease. Oh, I am weary because of it,
and yet I can find no fault with him. During
the last three days, which must have tried him,
he has been most discreet. But did you think”—she
turned to me—“when he broke in upon
the singing to provoke debate, that he meant
to turn the talk to some other meaning than it
had?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I am sure of it. Listen,” she said;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“if this is true what you tell me about Mancha,
I shall have enough to watch, for the greatest
danger will be when the Ward comes home
again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She will have been six months away from
her friends, she will be tired in body and the
glow of the ceremonial will be gone, her heart
will turn toward her family, and the secret
will weigh upon her. Then, if ever, she will
need counsel and support—when she comes
back—when she first comes.” She said the
words over to herself. “Mancha I can trust
as far as I can trust any man in love; but the
girl—I will say no more of her than that she
is much like other girls. I shall be busy there.
Ravenutzi I cannot watch, he disturbs me too
much. Do you see as much of him as possible
and bring me word.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There being no reason why I should not,
I promised readily, and so concluded the interview.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was anxious though to see Herman as soon
as possible, and sent Lianth that evening to
ask him to come to the middle meadow when
the stars came out in the blue above the dim,
receding ranges. But he did not come, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>I walked there a long time and saw the dark
well out of the cañons. I felt the night
scents begin to stir with the little winds, and
the tall sequoias bend their tops and talk together,
and my heart cracked with expectancy
with every snapped twig and rustling of wild
things going down to drink. I shouldn’t have
minded his not coming if he had anything else
to do, but I minded being kept waiting for
him. I minded it still more the next morning
when I met him at Fallen Tree and he said,
quite as if he had not thought of it until that
time:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, by the way—I was down at the Hollow
last night with Mancha and some of the
others. Was it anything particular you wanted
to say to me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, of course, I had supposed it was
rather particular when I had given him such
an opportunity to tell me all about his plan
and get forgiven for not telling it before. I
had meant to warn him that Trastevera, and
so, of course, Persilope, had reason to distrust
his mixing himself too much in the affairs of
Outland. But of course if he didn’t see it
that way himself there was no occasion for
me to be concerned about it. So I said:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“No, nothing particular.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” he said, “when this affair is all
over”—just as if it were in any wise his affair—“we
must get together and have a good
talk somewhere.” And though it was mid-morning
and there was nothing whatever to
do if he wished to talk, he went off up the
creek, and that was the last I saw of him until
evening.</p>

<p class='c010'>Directly after noon I took Lianth with me
and went out toward the Leap and then up
the bank of a tributary rill, and so into a part
of the wood where the Outliers did not much
frequent. Lianth, who was a great talker,
grew more and more quiet as my replies were
more absent, and the way grew steeper. We
could see the ground rising in front of us
through the trees, and hear the noise of the
creek falling far behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy was walking very close to me, and
there was a shy color coming in his cheek;
he glanced right and left under his half long
lashes and came very close.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, isn’t she?” he said. “Isn’t she as
beautiful as I said—you know who?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Zirriloë?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Lianth,” said I, “if you think I have
brought you out here to give you a chance to
talk about forbidden things, you are mistaken.
I came because I wished to be alone. I’m going
a little farther among the trees, and don’t
you come until I call you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was helping me up over a broken ledge
as I spoke, and stopped there looking at me
irresolutely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You aren’t going to try and run away, are
you? You look as though you were—from
something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only from you. You can give the call, and
if I don’t answer you can come to look for
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I had learned already many of the Outland
methods of communicating by forest notes
rather than trust to the betraying, high-pitched
human voice. None of these was of
more use to me than the call for refuge. If
any Outlier wished to be private in his place,
he raised that call, which all who were within
hearing answered. Then whoever was on his
way from that placed hurried, and whoever
was coming toward it stayed where he was until
he had permission to move on. Though
Lianth was somewhat taken aback at my demand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>I knew I should have some little space
unmolested.</p>

<p class='c010'>I climbed on between great roots of pines
where the litter lay in hummocks between the
tracks of winter torrents, and Lianth had
called twice before I bethought myself to answer
him and claim a longer time. I lay
down at last in a place where the scrub was a
screen to me, and before I understood what
had happened, the laboring breath of my
climbing had burst into thick, choking sobs.
I lay face down on the pine litter and was
most terribly shaken with the grief of some
dumb, wounded thing in me that did not know
its hurt, but wrenched and cried a long time
unrelievingly. It was so new a thing for me
to cry and so strange, that though I knew this
was what I had come there for, I did not
know why I was torn so almost to the dividing
of soul and spirit. The crying lasted a long
time, and I was so exhausted by it that it was
only by faint degrees I became aware of eyes
upon me. I roused up hastily, afraid lest in
the violence of my grief I had failed to answer
some inquiry of Lianth’s and he had
come to find me.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instead, I met the curious, commiserating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>eyes of a woman fixed on me through the leafage
of the scrub. As soon as she perceived
that I saw her she parted the brush and came
through, holding it still in her hands behind
her, as though it were a door of exit to be
kept open. I saw at once by her figure, which
was slight and tall, by her dark hair and by
her dress, that she was not one of the Outliers.
Over her tunic she had wound a long cloak
of dark stuff, concealing her limbs, and over
that bound vines and wreathed the leaves in
her hair, for adornment or concealment. As
she stood in the shadow there was little to be
discerned of her but the thin oval of her face
and the long throat clasped by linked silver
ornaments finely wrought.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are not of the Outliers?” she questioned,
though I felt she was already sure of
the fact.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am their prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I thought she seemed pleased at that, more
pleased if, with a swift searching of my
swollen eyes, I could have answered yes to her
next question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They do not treat you well? But no”—answering
herself—“it is not so that captives
cry. What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“Mona.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She said it over two or three times to fix
it in her memory; and then, caution and curiosity
struggling in her:</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have just come from them? You
know them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you”—I could see the pulse of her long
throat and the bushes shake behind with her
agitation—“do you know Ravenutzi?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he well? How does he look? Is he
happy?” Impossible to conceal now what the
question meant to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is well. As to his looks—sometimes he
looks younger, sometimes older. His hair, I
think, is not so gray.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not so gray?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think he dyes it.” I do not know why
I should have said this, except as I saw that
no detail of him was too small to seem trivial
to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” she said, startled, looking at me
queerly. “Oh!” she gave a short laugh, “you
think he dyes it. Is he happy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I considered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are one of the Far-Folk, I believe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>and though I am prisoner, the Outliers have
been friends to me. I am not sure I ought to
answer you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She let go of the bushes and came a step
nearer in her anxiety.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you are a woman who has wept in
secret, and by the hurt which brought your
tears,” she said, “only tell me if he is well and
happy. Surely that cannot touch your honor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have already said he is well. He has
the vigor of a young man. As for happiness—he
says very little, and that not of himself.
At least he is not openly unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me,” she urged, “if you could imagine
that in his own land he is well loved,
that there is one there who lives in him,
dreams of him, counts the hours; could you
say that he found the time of his hostage heavy
because of her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is thoughtful at times, and walks by
himself. Otherwise I could not judge. I have
not loved myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For answer she let her eyes wander pointedly
over my disfigured face and fallen hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me again,” she said after an interval.
“This girl who is the Ward, is she very beautiful?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“Very;” but not so beautiful as you, I
thought, for there was in the vivid red of her
fine lips, in the purple of her eyes and the
delicate tragic arch of her brows, in the long
throat and bosom, all that fire and motion of
passion which the Ward’s face hinted at elusively.
I was casting about for a way of saying
this to her not too boldly when I was advised
by the tapping of her foot on the needles
that she would not be turned from her inquiry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Ravenutzi, is he interested in her?
Is he much about her? Does she care for
him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is the Ward,” I said, “she may not
think of men; and besides, she is only a girl,
her thought would hardly turn to a white
head.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“True, true”—she pinched her lip with
thumb and forefinger—“I had forgotten; as
you say, he is a very old man. No doubt he
might be judged old enough to have speech
with her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I, not seeing fit to reply to that, rose and
stood looking at her, very curious on my own
account, but knowing very well that I should
get nothing from her except what pleased her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Shall I tell him you inquired for him?”
I wished politely to know, and was startled at
her whiteness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, no, no! Do not tell him—tell no one
lest he hear of it; he would be very angry, he
would——” She recovered herself. “Ravenutzi
is very honorable. He would not wish
to break the terms of his hostage, which are
that he should not communicate with the Far-Folk
for three years. It is a long time,” she
said piteously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A long time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then,” she said, “if you could understand
how I—how his friends would wish to assure
themselves that he is well, you can see that we
would not wish him disturbed by knowing
how much he is missed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I understand very well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then”—relieved—“you will perhaps tell
no one that you have seen me. And if I could
come so near again—I could not have managed
it except that they are all busy at their
Meet—if I could let you know, you would
not deny me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I suppose the exhaustion of long sobbing
had left me in a yielding mood. I saw no
harm in satisfying her anxiety, and said so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>though I added that I might not be long myself
among the Outliers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you are there I will find a way to let
you know,” she assured me, and with that she
threw herself into the arms of the waiting
wood, which received and seemed to snatch
her from my view.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>VII<br /> <span class='large'>HERMAN DEVELOPS HIS IDEA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>On the third day, when the shadows
were all out full length in the upper
basin, the sun blinking palely
from behind a film of evening gray,
the Maiden Ward came back. Some children
paddling for trout in the soddy runnels saw
her come and ran crying the news among the
evening fires. Hearing it the women all ran
together distractedly, declaring that there
could be no proper welcome with no men
about. This, I thought, was very quickly noted
by the girl, glancing this way and that,
losing a little of the high carriage and manner
as she saw how few observed it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl was white, her eyes strained wide
in dark circles of fatigue. Streakings of her
fair body showed through the torn dress. I
saw her check and stumble, putting out her
hands blindly, overburdened by her hair.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Remembering what importance Trastevera
had attached to this returning, I looked about
for her, ready to serve or see. Before I could
reach her, up came Ravenutzi from his pot of
coals and anvil of flint stone down where the
rush of the cascade covered the tinkle of his
hammers. I could not help noting the likeness
between him and Trastevera as he came,
putting off his smith’s apron ready to her use
like a proffered tool. Some nods, I think, a
gesture or two of Trastevera’s, were all that
passed between them. Some essential maleness
leapt up in him at the motions of those
small talking hands, and took command of the
situation. I found myself running with the
women at his word to spread skins for the
Ward to rest upon, and ordering the children
in two lines to some show of ceremonial welcome.
There were some young brothers of
hers in that band, and as she kissed them heartily
I saw tears stealing, and realized how
young she was and how hard a thing she had
undertaken. She stood with a palm behind
her flat against a pine for support, overtired
and wanting her mother, no doubt, who was
not allowed to come to her. Finally the
women took her away to rest.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>In all this I had never seen Ravenutzi show
to so great advantage. When we were quite
alone Trastevera put out her hand to him as
she did not often in the presence of Outliers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kinsman,” she said, and it was the first
time I had heard her call him that, “I owe
you thanks for this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She meant more than that he had contrived
some warmth for what must otherwise have
seemed to Zirriloë a cold returning. She was
thankful that it had been his wrinkles and
streaked grayness to meet the Ward rather
than the hot eyes and shining curls of Mancha.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know how it is,” said she, “I never
pitied myself for being the Ward, but somehow
this pink girl seems to need to be pitied.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any bond,” said Ravenutzi, “will wear at
times,” and said it with a wistful back-stroke
of self-commiseration that caused me to think
swiftly of several things. I reflected that in
his own place among the Far-Folk he must
have been more of a man than the Outliers
conceded to any smith. Next, that the condition
of tame cat, which his hostageship incurred,
pressed more heavily on him than they
were in the habit of thinking. Also I thought
of the tall woman, but I did not deliver the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>comforting reassurance about her which came
readily to my tongue. There was so intimate
and personal a quality in his brief surrender
to our sympathy that it made the mention of
another woman an intrusion. It began to seem
likely that she could not be so much to him as
he to her. That would account both for her
anxiety not to have him know of her inquiry,
and for his not having mentioned her to Trastevera.</p>

<p class='c010'>We continued walking up and down under
the linked pines, without many words, but with
a community of understanding, which led
later to Trastevera’s opening to him more of
her anxieties than she realized. In the course
of an hour or two the women brought the
Ward back again, and made her a little entertainment
of compliments and songs. There
was a hard, bright moon in a pale ring, and
the breath of the young year stealing through
the forest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Prassade sang, and Evarra’s man and old
Noche. The women sang all together, rocking,
as they sat, but Ravenutzi sang the most
and most movingly. Mancha sang nothing;
sat off fondling his weapon, and drank the
girl’s looks. She was very lovely, had got back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>a little of her saint’s separateness which became
her, and the conscious support of being
admired. If she had looked at him, she might
have seen his heart swimming under his gaze,
but I could not see that she did. What favor
she was disposed to show went to Ravenutzi,
praising his songs and affecting to be affected.
I thought she built too much on the mere incident
of his having been the only one of the
men to meet her. It was a mere accident growing
out of the nature of his work, but it was
natural, perhaps, to have rewarded him for
it. The women took her away early, and
nothing whatever had happened.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next day, which ordinarily would have
seen the parting of the Meet, occurred the
Council, which broke up in some disorder,
without having accomplished anything. Very
early a blind fog came nosing up from the
sea, cutting between the round-backed hills,
shouldering them like a herd-dog among
sheep. It threaded unsuspected cañons, and
threw up great combs of tall, raking trees
against its crawling flanks. It gripped the
peaks, spreading skyward, whirling upon itself
in a dry, ghostly torrent. The chill that
came with the fog drove us down toward Deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Fern, to a sun-warmed hollow defended by
jutty horns of the country rock. Shed leaves
crackled under us, the wind and fog were
stayed by the tall pines at our backs, the sun
warmed whitely through the hurrying mist.</p>

<p class='c010'>Evarra and some others of the women were
there, Zirriloë and the two keepers beginning
their daily turns, and Ravenutzi, sitting with
his long knees drawn up under his clasped
hands. Somewhere out of sight the men were
holding council on a matter they had not seen
fit to speak to us about. We had scarcely settled
ourselves on the warm leaf-drift when
one of them came to the head of the Hollow
and shouted for Noche. There were so many
of us about, the old man could have safely
left the Ward but it seemed to him scarcely
courtesy to do so with her Wardship yet so
new. He glanced around through the smother
of the fog and found not another man who
could be spared to that duty. Ravenutzi, with
his chin upon his knees, and his velvety opaque
eyes looked idly at nothing, but was aware of
the old man’s difficulty. Noche clapped him
heavily on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hey, smith,” he said, “will you take a
watch for me? I am wanted.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>At this the man who leaned to us dimly
from the rim of the Hollow gave a grunt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What,” he said, “will you set the Far-Folk
to watch a Ward? These are gentle
times.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, he is as gray as I am, and twice as
wrinkled,” answered Noche, mightily disconcerted.
“Would you have him come to the
Council instead?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The other laughed shortly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, not to the Council, though I daresay
it will come to that yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He released the young tree upon which he
leaned, which sprang back with a crackling
sound. From his silence Noche drew consent
to his half-jesting proposal and, smiling embarrassedly,
like a chidden child, swung his
great body up by the trunk of a leaning oak
and disappeared behind the smoky fog. By
such intimations we knew there was something
going forward among the men, but we
did not know how much of this the Ward,
who was most involved by it, surmised. She
might have guessed from our not referring to
these mysterious comings and goings that it
concerned the keeping of the Treasure. She
grew uneasy, started at sounds, would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Trastevera hold her hand, was in need of
stroking and reassuring.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fog increased, hurrying and turning
upon itself. Runnels of cooler air began to
pour through it, curling back the parted films
against the trees. Now and then one of these
air-streams, deflected by the rim of the Hollow,
would rush up its outer slope, blowing
leaves and dust like a fountain, and, subsiding,
leave us more sensible of warmth and
ease, in the thick leaf litter below the oaks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ravenutzi came over to Trastevera, who sat
holding the Ward’s hand, and stretched himself
at her feet, smiling up at her his fawn’s
smile. He held up his hand between him and
the pale smear of sunlight with one of those
slight, meaningful gestures so natural to him
that it served as a more delicate sort of speech:
“Surely it seemed to say, to-day not even I can
cast a shadow?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Trastevera, like one too deep in thought to
rise to the surface of words, smiled back. Not
finding himself in disfavor, Ravenutzi ventured
a little more to lure her from disturbing
meditation. He turned upon his side, leaning
on his elbow, and began to sing. His voice
was mellow and of a carrying quality, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>tang in it like the taste of the honey-comb in
wild honey. Some half-governed energy of
passion kept it under his breath as the warm
earth was held under the smother of the fog.
It was a song of the Far-Folk, I know, for
there were some words in it not common to
the Outliers, but it had their method of carrying
the mood in the movement and the mind
of the singer, rather than in the words.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Oh, a long time.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>it said,</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Have I been gathering lilies in the dawn-dim woodland.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh, long—long!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>and ran on into a sound like the indrawing of
breath before tears, and began again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Scented and sweet is the house</div>
      <div class='line'>And the door swings outward,</div>
      <div class='line'>It is made fair with lilies:</div>
      <div class='line'>But there are no feet on the trail to the house</div>
      <div class='line'>And the door swings outward.</div>
      <div class='line'>Long, O long, have I been gathering lilies.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Just that, three times over; and the first time
of the singing it was a girl wreathing herself
with flowers and looking down the trail, sure
of her lover but sighing for his delay. Then it
was the tall woman I had met in the wood,
keeping her empty house with fierce loyalty
through the years of his hostage.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Long, oh long, have I been gathering lilies!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Finally it was a heart made fair with unrequited
tendernesses, singing to itself through
all the unimpassioned years. Strangely it was
I singing that song and walking through it in
a bewildered mist of pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not know how long it was after Ravenutzi
ceased before I could separate myself
from the throbbing of the song. I was recalled
sharply by the wish to comfort Zirriloë,
whose young egotism, suffering perhaps in the
withdrawal of attention from herself, had
startled us all by turning her face on Trastevera’s
shoulder and bursting into tears. It
was pure hysteria, I thought, but she was so
very pretty in it. There was such appeal of
childishness in the red, curling lip, the trembling
of her delicate bosom, that I was drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>in spite of myself into the general conspiracy
to restore her to the balance of cheerfulness.
Ravenutzi, realizing that his song was in a
manner to blame, was so embarrassed in his
dismay and so wistful of our good opinion,
that the girl was obliged to come out of her
tears to reassure him. He, to requite the forgiveness,
began to be at once so gay and charming
in his talk that in a very little time we
had returned to that even breathing lightness
of mood which was the habit of the Outliers.
Content welled out of the earth and overflowed
us like some quiet tide, disturbed only
as some sharp jet of human emotion sprang
up fountain-wise momentarily beyond the
level, and dropped back again to vital, pulsing
peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>We had no more disturbances that day, and
I felt that Trastevera, much as she was concerned
about the Council, could only have
been thankful for so commonplace an occasion.
We were both glad that the quick-blooded
Mancha had business, which kept him out
of the way until the Ward had recovered a
little from the self-consciousness of her situation.
When about three hours had gone over
us, Persilope came stooping under the hanging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>boughs, gave us Good Friending somewhat
briefly, and took his wife away with him.
From time to time after that, one or another
woman slipped away, answering some call of
her mate out of the mist. When we heard the
fluttering shriek of a hawk given rapidly
twice, and again impatiently, without space
for replying we all laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is your man, Evarra! One would
think the woods were a-fire!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Evarra blushed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Assuredly, he would set them a-fire when
he is in that state if he did not find me.” She
made a sign to me. “Come,” she said; “now
we shall hear what it is all about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Council, so Evarra’s husband told us,
was not the immediate outcome of the incidents
of the Meet. Matter for it had been
growing these ten years past, ever since the
unearthing and reburial of the Treasure had
been undertaken on Trastevera’s account. It
had been so long since they had any feeling
of its reality, except as the point on which
their honor hung! But after Noche had seen
the Treasure, the craftsman’s soul of him was
forever busy with the wonders of it, brooding
on the fire of its jewels as a young man on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>beam of a maiden eye. All the children who
had come to maturity these ten years past had
been nourished on the Treasure tale, livened
and pointed by Noche’s account. With the
advent of the hostage, interest in the King’s
Desire as a possession had rather increased
through the awakened appreciation of smith’s
work among them. Ravenutzi had made curious
ornaments for the women of bits of
metal found in deserted summer camps, the
patterns of which reproduced, so far as the
Far-Folk remembered them, the wrought gold
of the King’s jewels.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both the items which were responsible
for this liveliness of curiosity—the exemption
of Trastevera and consequent reburial
of the Treasure, and the acceptance of the
hostage—had been strongly opposed by part
of the Council. Now they thought themselves
justified by the turn of events. They thought
further that the incident of Daria and her
lover called loudly for measures which should
stem this current of departure from old usage.
A Ward had been released from her obligation
of forgetfulness; another had ventured to
plead for it. A young man had loved a Ward
and dared to avow it during the term of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Wardship. Here was one of the Far-Folk
teaching smitheying to the Outliers. Here
were House-Folk going about among them
talking of forbidden things. Matter enough
for Council if ever Council was. More disconcerting,
here was Mancha, Ward of the
Outer Borders, Mancha of the Hammerers,
who had opposed the hostage and stood for
the inviolateness of obligation, come out suddenly
as the leader, the precipitator, of revolt.
Evarra’s man fumed over this and the probable
reason for it. Upon which point, though
I was at no loss myself, I did not see fit to enlighten
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Council had begun soberly in the consideration
as to whether some formal penalty
should be visited on the Ward who had dared
to love, and the man who had ventured to
love her. It had been disrupted widely by
the question, which seemed to spring up simultaneously
among the younger men, as to
why there should be a Ward at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the nature and the exquisite charm
of the life of Outland that it could not carry
superfluous baggage either of custom or equipment.
Question as to the continuance could
not have arisen had there not run before it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>some warning of dead weight, like the creaking
of a blasted bough about to fall. Such
warning they had in the incidents about which
the Council was met. The mere question was
not so disquieting as the speech Mancha made
upon it, a speech which, proceeding from an
impulse perhaps not very well defined in his
own mind, and not guessed by his audience.
His private determination to get Zirriloë free
so that he might make love to her, was neither
very direct in its process nor clear in its conclusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why, said Mancha, waste the youth of a
girl, always the chiefest and loveliest, keeping
a Treasure for which the Far-Folk had ceased
to struggle. Did they not prefer pilferings
of House-Folk? Had they not sold their best
man for a free passage to the Ploughed Lands?
Honor, said he, had been kept alive by the
custom of the Maiden Ward. But was honor
so little among the Outliers that they had to
buy it at the price of a girl’s love-time?</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, declared Mancha of the Hammerers,
it was a form of honor which they did
not trust her to keep. Besides, keeping was
the business of men. Further, said the Ward
of the Outer Borders, not having made it very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>clear where his speech tended up to this point,
there was a better way of keeping the Treasure
effectively out of reach of the Far-Folk.
There was a way costing them nothing of
which, since it was new to him, and he no
speech-maker—this much was sufficiently
clear at any rate—he begged leave to let Herman
of the House-Folk put for him. This
was what broke and scattered the Council like
a blast of wind on burning leaves. They blew
out this way and that, sparking and flaring,
saying it was an incredible thing and impossible
that the House-Folk should come to
Council, or, coming, should have anything to
say worth hearing. Some blamed Mancha
and some the occasion. Some there were who
laughed, unbound their slings and went hunting.
Said they:</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is mere child’s talk, when you have
business afoot call us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Others, deeply angered at the flouting of old
customs, went out suddenly, picked up their
women with a sign and set out without farewells
for their own places. Of these we heard
nothing again until a greater occasion grown
out of that same slighted Council called them.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were many, however, and these chiefly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>of the younger men, who stayed to hear
Herman’s idea, which was as he explained to
me a little later at the pine tree by the shallows,
perfectly feasible. It was nothing less
than that the Outliers should become, as he
said, civilized.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is quite impossible, you know, that they
should go on living like this indefinitely.
They are practically cut off from the sea already,
and every summer there are more and
more campers. Think how these hills would
be overrun, and with what sort of people, if
we went back to Fairshore and told what we
know of the Treasure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, we aren’t going to be allowed to.
Do you remember last summer how one of a
hunting party in these same hills wandered
away from his companions and was found afterwards,
dazed and witless? He was thought
to have had a fall or something. But now I
know that like us, he stumbled on the Outliers
and they gave him the Cup.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That may work very well when they get
us singly,” Herman agreed, “but a whole party
of campers now—the wonder is they have
been exempt so long. Their trails go everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>I could have reminded Herman then of one
who walked in their trails and believed them
trodden out by deer, who caught them nearly
at their faggot gathering and thought only of
wood-choppers. Or I might have asked him
if even now he could find any Outlier in the
woods who did not wish to be found. But I
waited to hear the whole of his idea.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are getting no good out of their
Treasure as it is, and paying too dear for its
keep. A girl like Zirriloë ought to be married,
you know&nbsp;... with all that capacity for
loving&nbsp;... what a wife she would make&nbsp;...
for&nbsp;... anybody.” I had not said anything
to the contrary, but Herman took on an insisting
tone. “She would pick up things,” he said,
“and her beauty would carry her anywhere——”
He broke off, staring into the brown
shallows as if he were watching of that beauty
carrying her somewhere out of the bounds of
her present life, and the sight pleased him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But your idea?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it’s only that they should take up
their Treasure, abolish all this business of the
Ward, and with the proceeds of the jewels
buy themselves a tract of land in which the
law could protect them from the encroachments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>of House-Folk and Far-Folk alike. I
know a man in the forestry bureau who would
be able to tell me how it could be managed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He said that with so great an implied indifference
to any objection I might entertain,
that I began to feel a very quick resentment.
I began to wonder if that old inclusive sympathy
had ever been at all, if indeed it had
not grown, as I felt this whole Outland experience
to have done, out of my expectant
wish for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would mean so much to us&nbsp;... to those
of us who care about such things,” he corrected
himself, as if already a little less sure of
me, “to have their social system working in
plain sight. Their notions of the common
good&nbsp;... I’ve talked with the men a bit&nbsp;...
what they’ve worked out without any of our
encumbrances, if they could take it up now
with all our practical advantages—the University
might establish a sort of protectorate——But
you don’t seem to care for the
idea, Mona.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I don’t know what I thought of the idea
as a solution of the troubles of the Outliers.
I thought of a great many practical objections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>afterward, but just then I knew what I
thought of Herman for proposing it.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were our Outliers—or I might have
said <i>my</i> Outliers, for I had imagined them,
believed in them and discovered them. It
was only Herman’s interest in me which had
brought him within their borders. It was a
unique and beautiful experience, and it was
ours. We had said that and had felicitated
ourselves so many times on its being an experience
we were having together. If we forgot
it we must have even our forgetfulness in
common as we had so many things—and here
was Herman willing to throw it open to the
world as an experiment in sociology. If Herman
felt that way about it, how was I to claim
that exquisite excluding community of interest
in which the adventure had begun!</p>

<p class='c010'>“I daresay,” I answered quickly, for I had
thought all this while he talked to me, “that
it is as good as most ideas of yours, but it
doesn’t interest me.” And I walked away
and left him staring into the water.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>VIII<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH HERMAN’S IDEA RECEIVES A CHECK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>To the dry fog succeeded showers and
intervals of super clearness. Vast
blunt-headed clouds blundered under
a high, receding heaven. Brown
croisers of the fern uncurled from the odorous
earth, some subtle instinct responded to the incessant
stir of sap. The Outliers left off debating
to run together flock-wise in the recrudescence
of the year. The wet wood was full
of whispering, all hours of the night feet went
by bearing laughter, not loud but chuckling
and daring.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless, the clearing of the weather
did not scatter them. Some there were whose
affairs had called them at the end of the
Meet. A few had gone in displeasure at the
turn of the Council. Mancha’s supporters, and
they were chiefly the young men, remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>in the neighborhood of Leaping Water and
Deep Fern, to which we had moved when the
rain began. Fretted argument would go on
where two or three of the men were met, disrupting
suddenly. There was a sense of
expectancy abroad. Men watched the Ward
for more than her beauty as she went with the
keepers, in a green gown like the sheath of a
bud, her face a flower.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ravenutzi got from Herman what silver
coins he had, and smithied them into a brooch
for her; it was rumored that you would find
the twin of that pattern in the King’s Desire.
Women grew curious, questioned me how the
House-Folk lived and loved. They laughed
and looked sidewise, but listened.</p>

<p class='c010'>All this curious possibility of Herman’s
idea, and the pricking sense of stir and
change, drew off attention from Mancha’s
passion, which burned up to the betraying
point. Trastevera, who remained steadily
aware of his state, credited to it mistakenly
all her unease and intimations of disaster.
Trouble ranged openly in the wood, but hid
its face. It seemed to swell at times toward
betrayal: I could see small hair bristling on
the necks of the men when they had sat quietly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>together, or one would throw up his head like
an uneasy hound. I think as the newness of
Herman’s proposal began to wear down, some
of them became aware of Mancha’s state, but
said nothing lest, uncovered too much in
speech, it would burst the quicker into
scandal.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had very little talk with the girl, as little
communication was allowed, even in company,
and Mancha made no special occasions.
Anywhere in her trail you might come upon
him mooning upon a flower she had dropped,
the bough she had leaned upon, the crumpled
fern. He would sit in the pleasant pauses of
the noon, the joints of his face loosened, his
gaze swimming as he looked at her, his hair
above his face was like pale fire. He was all
molten white with passion; if the girl breathed
upon him he would have burst ravening into
flame.</p>

<p class='c010'>Trastevera was afraid that the Ward, quick,
for all her simple seeming, to observe her effect
upon men, would become aware of Mancha’s
love for her and kindle her imagination
at the vanity of this conquest. Any girl might
well have been touched by the love of a man
worth so much as men are accounted worth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Ravenutzi knew, and managed to make his
knowledge seem to grow out of his wish to
relieve the perturbation of Trastevera, of
whom he was always considerately observant.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a quick sympathy of instinct between
those two dark ones, and he served her
with that fatal appeal to women, of sweetness
struggling with some baser attribute, toward
her good opinion. He had the air when in
her presence, and under her approbation, of
having climbed into it out of some native unworthiness.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was an air calculated to make any woman
generous in the bestowal of her company. By
degrees Trastevera fell into the way of letting
him serve her by interposing a screen between
Zirriloë and the Hammerer’s too unguarded
gaze. Often in the still noons when Mancha’s
adoring mind burned through all the drowsy
silences, he would make a diversion, singing
or relating one of his long tales.</p>

<p class='c010'>For my part, I was not so sure either of
Mancha’s inarticulateness or of Zirriloë’s unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have times now of believing that the girl
had observed him, and contrived ways to keep
our attention turned on the possible chance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>his passion coming to a head. Though I cannot
now name any single circumstance that
points the suspicion, except as I came finally
to believe her capable of any duplicity! I
remember how Lianth attached himself to
Mancha with what seemed then the natural
devotion of youth to a hero. Now this appears
as a subtle movement of jealousy, to
bring himself more to attention by keeping in
conspicuous company.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl herself had a trick lately of turning
her head; little fluttering, nesting movements
as she sat, pretty pursing of the lips, as
of a woman knowing herself adored. She had
a way, when left to herself, of letting her work
fall in her lap, lips a little apart and dreaming
eyes. There was a soft flutter of her young
breast like a dove’s; a woman owned adorable.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was more, though it never came to
the point where I was justified in speaking of
it. Once in the clear interval between the
rains, I walked beside the tributary rill that
watered the meadow of Deep Fern and saw
the Ward sitting close against a bank clothed
thick with laurel and azaleas, an impenetrable
screen. She had been helping Noche and one
of the women strip willows for fish-weirs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>The two keepers were down by the streamside,
steeping the white wands and turning them
in the water in full sight of her and scarcely
out of earshot. Whatever Noche and the
woman might have been saying was cut off by
the frothy gurgle of the creek. They said it
to one another without so much as an over-shoulder
glance at Zirriloë. Yet there she sat
by the laurel bank, <i>listening</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Plainly she listened; with her head turned
a little aside, the lips curling and the lids half
drawn on the luminous dark eyes. A woman
beguiled if ever there was one! Behind her
the laurel swayed slightly though there was no
wind. It swayed and showed the light underside
of leaves, and then was still as I came
walking by the waterside and Noche called to
me.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had to walk some distance down the creek
to the stepping-stones and across them toward
the laurel bank. Before I had gone very far
on that trail I met Ravenutzi returning by it.
I had no sooner caught sight of him than there
flashed up in him that suffusing spark of personality,
so excluding of all other considerations
that it gave to our casual meeting the
appearance of a thing done for its own sake.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>That was why I did not go on to discern to
what or whom Zirriloë had listened, but I
found myself turning in the trail to walk back
with him, quite as if, as his manner assumed,
I had come out on it expressly to meet him.
He began to tell me at once, as if that were the
object of his excursion, that he had not found
some herbs on the high bank that Evarra had
sent him for, and that he thought they could
hardly be out of the ground yet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And did you meet any one in the wood as
you came through?” I remember asking, my
thoughts returning to the Ward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only Mancha.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He gave me an odd, quick, sidelong look
as he spoke, and began to talk of other things,
as if he had seen more than that and did not
mean to tell. Whether he had kept the same
inviolacy with Trastevera, or she herself had
seen something, the very next day she sought
out the Hammerer, sitting on the burl of redwood,
nursing his hammer between his knees,
and taxed him with his passion for the Ward
and its unworthiness.</p>

<p class='c010'>He admitted the fact but not that it discredited
him. He would not remind Trastevera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>that she had been excused from part of the
obligation of her Wardship, but he said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Am I worth so little to the Outliers that
they would not excuse this girl to be my wife?
Ay, I want her,” he confessed; then as his
stout-built body thrilled at the thought, threw
out his arms, reddening, and laughed shamelessly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know the rocking-stone on the top
of the ledge by The Gap, that four men can
barely stir on its pivot? I could rock it into
the river to-day with the strength of my wanting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what would come in through the
River Wall if you did?” said she; but Mancha
would not talk of that.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know,” he said, “what the years of
my life are to me, the years I have gone mateless?
They are the stops in a pipe that plays
a tune to my need of her. I hear them piping
behind me and my blood runs to the music.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It shall play you a ten years’ measure yet,”
she answered him, “before it pipes you your
desire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not ten moons,” he insisted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then,” said she, “it will pipe death to you
and to your honor.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>He hid his face in his hands at that, groaned
and bit upon his fingers. At last:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought I should have had sympathy
from you who have loved so well,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>She could not deny him the comfort he so
sorely needed on that point, but neither could
she let him go without advising him what confusion
must come of his persistence in his unhappy
passion. He heard her, sliding his
great hammer from hand to hand as though it
were the argument balancing this way and
that in his mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“True, true,” he would admit; “it is all true
that you say.” And more quietly, as she went
on with an ingenuity of entreaty and explication:
“You are right, Trastevera, you are always
right;” and at last: “I thank you for
this, Trastevera; now I see what I must do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood up, putting her aside, for she had
got down on the ground attempting to stay the
rocking of his hammer as she would have
stopped the wavering of his mind. He
stretched himself under the redwood and
rapped so loudly with his weapon on the
trunk that the squirrels and nuthatches in the
upper stories came out to see, and wood bees
droned discontentedly within.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“It is true that she may not be loved during
the time of her Wardship,” said he; “there
must be an end to that, or worse will come of
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you will end it, Mancha, for your
honor’s sake?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As soon as may be; I have dawdled too
long. Where is Herman?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With Persilope at Lower Fern. What do
you want of him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What you wished: to put an end to this
business of the Ward.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mancha, Mancha! That is not what I
meant. You must put an end to your loving!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does loving end?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Trastevera gave up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What will you do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will find Herman first.” She heard
him rapping his purpose to the fore on the
deep-sounding trunks of trees as he went.</p>

<p class='c010'>You may guess how much comfort Trastevera
got out of this interview, of which she
told me very little at this time, perhaps because
she had failed, and perhaps because of
an incident occurring about that time which
put it wholly out of mind. One of the Outliers
who had set out for home on the breaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>up of the Council had found a suspicious circumstance,
and came crying with it all the
way up by River Ward to Deep Fern and Deer
Lake Hollow.</p>

<p class='c010'>He with his wife and young brood passing
over Singing Ford into the district of broad-headed
oaks, where there was low scrub of
lupin and rhus, had met Daria setting snares
in the rabbit runways. He had sung out a
greeting to her, for the moment forgetting her
state of forgetfulness, and she had stood up in
the knee-high lupin with her hand across her
eyes, taken unawares, and called him by his
name. It had popped out, startling at sight of
him like a rabbit from a burrow. Then as he
stood still with astonishment she checked and
stammered, recalled the word, protested that
she had mistaken him for another, and at last
broke and fled crying through the chaparral.
The Outlier, a just man but a little slow, considered
the circumstance, went on, in fact, a
whole stage of his journey before he arrived at
a conclusion. Whereupon he sent on his family
toward home, and came back all the way
to Deep Fern with his news, which had grown
upon him momentously as he traveled. Daria
remembered! How much?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Had the drink been made too light for her.
Had the tumult of her mind resisted sleep.
Or had her soul been so upborne by love that
it floated clear of the drug that drowned her
sense?</p>

<p class='c010'>No one of the women had been with her
when she recovered. Those whose custom it
was to watch the Ward into wakefulness delicately
withdrawing for the lover’s sake.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Remember, oh remember,” he had insisted
to the last, and she had remembered the name
and face of a man not in her own district.
How then would her memory stand toward
familiar things?</p>

<p class='c010'>This was disconcerting news indeed. There
were some who blamed Persilope, who had
poured out a portion of the drink. Others
blamed the women for not staying by her.
Trastevera blamed herself, and was tormented
afresh, seeing as a departure from good
usage of which she herself was source and
center. Mancha and Herman found it another
reason for pushing their idea, which the
Hammerer by this time openly avowed. As
if his admission of his passion had in a measure
defined him to himself, he had shaken off
the outward evidence of it, and was occupied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>chiefly in bringing his purpose to completion.
He had not spoken to Zirriloë since his talk
with Trastevera, sat no more mooning in the
woods, but went about everywhere among the
young men with Herman at his shoulder,
making adherents.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what is your objection to it?” Herman
had asked of me, sitting under the drawn
flaps of Evarra’s hut, upon which the rain
drummed hollowly. I had a great many objections,
based upon my conviction that no
amount of Treasure would buy immunity for
the Outliers once they were made known to
men. But all my reasons would have lacked
their proper cogency with Herman, who was
like the Outliers in being too honorable to
predict dishonor on the part of others. I
knew too little of business to forecast the hindrances
likely to fall in the way. All I was
sure of was that it was a mistake, first and
last it was bound to be a mistake, and very
little progress of the affair would prove it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you think so well of their way of life,”
said I, “why do you wish to change it? They
wouldn’t be happy in our way; it wouldn’t
agree with them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you’re thinking about happiness, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>about Daria? And Zirriloë; do you call it
happiness to be cut off from all that belongs
to youth and loveliness? Why, the girl was
made for loving.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I thought that was something you
didn’t believe in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He had the grace to blush here and to be
disconcerted, but he protested:</p>

<p class='c010'>“They believe in it—and I—sometimes I
think I am only learning what it is to be alive.
All alive, not just the intellect of me, like
mistletoe at the top of a tree. And it’s good”—he
scuffed with his feet strongly on the
ground as though he liked the sting of it—“so
good that I want to make it sure.” Before I
could ask him what that had to do with making
a sociological experiment of the Outliers,
he had turned the argument again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Besides, Mona,” with almost an injured
air, “I’m thinking of you. We know too
much ever to be allowed to leave here in possession
of all our faculties. Unless we go in
some such way as I suggest, as emissaries to
arrange for the title to their lands——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” I assented; “I hadn’t thought of
that. We could go out that way, and then we
needn’t say any more about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Well,” he admitted doubtfully, “that
wasn’t exactly what I had in mind. That
doesn’t seem quite—right, does it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I thought it would be as right as turning
loose on the Outliers all the ills of our social
disorder. But I didn’t feel like saying anything
further just then. I sat and watched the
sheeted rain that veiled the world a rod beyond
our door, saw the sun break and silver it,
and heard the wind calling from the high
ridges.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is either to go back that way,” Herman
insisted, “or stripped and unremembering.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you were to forget all you know and had
to begin over again,” I suggested, “there
would be a sociological experiment for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mona, you don’t really want to forget all
this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know,” I said; “a little forgetting
is good medicine.” And singularly I thought
of the tall woman in the woods, and wondered
when I should see her again, and what she
would have thought of Herman’s idea.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the last of the rains, and the very
morning of the day when the Outlier from
beyond the Singing Ford came back with the
word about Daria. Messengers were sent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>fetch her and her husband, and all we of Deep
Fern went down half a day to meet them. The
messengers had found the former Ward and
her young husband on their way, drawn by
our wish and their own willingness. Love
had made them subservient, emptied them of
self.</p>

<p class='c010'>The examination took place in a half hollow
full of trees. What sunlight there was
lay in white patches like a stain. All up the
green and golden slope the women sat listening,
now discovered by the stirring of the
wind on their loose garments, now disappearing
in stillness. Daria stood up among the
men and answered faithfully. It was true, she
admitted, that she remembered things. Some
things. She did not know how much. She
had just begun to connect facts with the vague
sense of familiarity. Questioned, the memories
revealed themselves but sticks and straws,
wreckage of experience, a name here, there a
trivial circumstance, and there a blank. All
of them such images as might have been floating
in her mind at the time, or a little before
she drank forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Did she remember the place of the Treasure?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The question, when it came, took her fairly.
She spun about, rocking her arms, burst into
dry sobbing. Give her the Cup, she said, she
would take the Cup again if they wished it,
but let her not be questioned any more. In a
broad splash of sunlight I could see her
shiver, but not her judges; their faculty for
quiescence served them better than speech.</p>

<p class='c010'>Did she remember?</p>

<p class='c010'>How could she say? She had not remembered
that there was a treasure until her husband
explained her situation to her. And
then suddenly while he talked there had come
into her mind a place in the hills, rocks, pine
trees, she did not know quite where, all the
rest of the country cut off in a mist like a
landscape in a dream. But there was the picture,
young pines posturing for the dance, and
all her attention centered on a certain spot. If
she happened upon that district she thought
she could have gone straight to that spot. She
broke off: begged them to deliver judgment.
But there were other considerations. Members
already scattered to their homes must be
summoned—there were formalities. The
meeting broke up quietly. Daria moved over
and placed herself beside Zirriloë, between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the keepers. Her husband did not come to
her, nor she look toward him. She was in
Ward again.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a sense of urgency now on all the
Outliers that led quickly to a final adjustment.
Everybody talked openly of the King’s Desire
and of Herman’s plan, of which they had no
very clear idea, I think, beyond its being a
more effectual way of hiding the Treasure.
It had also the merit of keeping their district
clear of House-Folk who fouled the meadows
and made them unlivable.</p>

<p class='c010'>I sought out Trastevera and said what I
could, with no success except to augment her
uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is no doubt what I saw entering by
Broken Tree with you,” she said, “but now it
is so close upon us my opinion is no better than
another woman’s, nor so good, I think. I see
trouble coming from afar and declare it, but
if I forget what I have declared, I fall into it
myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I looked for Herman then and found him
at Lower Fern.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So,” I said, “you are determined to go on
with this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What else?” He looked surprised, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>then reproachful. “If you would stop to
think, Mona, what it might mean to me, to all
of us, to take back to our world, where as yet
we have only theorized about it, news of a
social order already accomplished where
every man’s greatest benefit is the common
good——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” I said, “I haven’t. What I’m thinking
about is what we would bring to the Outliers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, if you look at it that way——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And there is something you ought to think
of, and that is if you promise to buy land and
protection for them, whether you have the
price. You haven’t really seen the Treasure,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But—but—Mona,” he expostulated, “it’s
all been so real. I never thought—that ceremony—the
Ward and all—of course I haven’t
seen it——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It may be pebbles,” I said, “or colored
glass.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I thought you believed in it? You
were the very first to believe it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>That was just like Herman. Of course I
believed in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>I can believe six impossible things before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>breakfast if it suits me, but Herman never
could be got to understand the difference between
a literary belief and a working certainty.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At any rate,” I said, “before you guarantee
the price of the King’s Desire, you would best
have a look at it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>IX<br /> <span class='large'>HOW THE KING’S DESIRE WAS DUG UP, AND BY WHOM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>How Herman injected into the hot
plans of Mancha this cold doubt
I do not know. If he accepted it
as a check to his enterprise there
was no visible abatement of its urgency. He
was forever and fatiguingly busy; crossing
over Singing Ford and returning between two
days. Passing beyond Moon Crest he visited
Alderhold and Bent Bow, fetching a circle
almost to Broken Tree to make adherents. He
was still and hungry as to his inner want, but
outwardly as noisy as a bear, rapping the
trunks of hollow trees or prodding the soft
earth with his hammer. If in the wood at
Deep Fern or Deer Lake Hollow he met with
his young men, he passed them without greeting.
It is doubtful if he saw them. Plainly
the man was ravined with desire.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>All this time he gave no trouble to the
Ward or her keepers. When she went among
the young fern, between the budding willows,
he did not seek her, never talked of himself
in her company. It was as if the eye of his
mind, so fixed upon the Mate, passed over the
Maid she was. Otherwise I do not know how
he could have withstood her, for she went
flushed and glorious. Trastevera, I know,
had expected tears and pining. Watching,
she was relieved to find the girl still sustained
by ecstasy, grew more at ease and trusted Ravenutzi.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the rest of the Outliers the hesitation of
Herman’s enterprise on the probable unworth
of the jewels proved no disappointment. It
was, in fact, a means of hurrying the movement
for removing it from its present cache.
They were curious to discover if the Treasure
really had such an intrinsic value as Herman
had taken for granted. Even though it proved
of no value to the House-Folk, it was something
the Far-Folk wanted very much. The
keeping of it provided an occupation, and the
promised unearthing an excitement for which
their long truce with the Far-Folk gave them
an appetite. In any case it must come up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>be hidden again, or they must administer the
Cup to Daria a second time. This involved a
wrenching of their sympathies they were unwilling
to endure, even if it lay in justice to
twice enforce her. They were the readier for
the enterprise since it appeared not necessarily
to involve the acceptance of Herman’s idea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Prassade and Persilope then, with Mancha
and Herman, of course, two of the keepers—the
same who had buried it—and several
strong men beside, set out for the cache of the
King’s Desire. They went north and seaward
by a shorter route than the Ward had taken,
since they had not the same need of doubling
for concealment. They passed the upper limit
of redwoods and came to a region of thin,
spiked spruce and pines, knuckly promontories
encrusted with lichen sticking out of a thin,
whitish soil. By afternoon they struck into a
gully where an opaque stream purled in shallow
basins and spilled in thin cascades to
gravely levels. Here they began to take note
of landmarks and measure distances. First
there was a sheer jut of country rock, stained
black by the dribble of a spring. Below it a
half moon of pond as green as malachite. Directly
up from that, on the shoulder of a stony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>hill, five pines, slender and virginal, stood
circlewise, bent somehow by weather stress to
the postures of dancing. They balanced in
the wind and touched the tips of their
stretched, maiden boughs.</p>

<p class='c010'>From here, ascending, the stream spindled
to a thread, and led the eye under the combe
of the ridge to a high round boulder, gripped
mid-long of its fall by the curled roots of a
pine. Under the boulder was the cache of the
King’s Desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>I asked Herman afterward how soon the intimation
of what they were to find there began
to reach them, and he said, to himself not at
all. He remembered Prassade asking of Noche,
if this was the trail they had taken with
the Ward, and the old man’s quick, sidewise
glance that questioned why he asked. He remembered
as they came by the green water,
one of the keepers stooping to examine something,
and Noche beginning to twitch and
bristle like a dog striking an unwelcome trail.
They came to the boulder. Signs of the recent
rains were all about, the half-uprooted pine
that braced it showed a slight but fresh abrasion
of the bark. The two keepers had their
heads together, whispering apart.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>They would not believe it! Even when the
first scraping of the wooden shovels showed
the soil loose and yielding, and below the percolating
dampness of the rains they found
filling of fresh, dry gravel, they would not
believe the cache had been rifled.</p>

<p class='c010'>The jewels were in a great chest, red and
rotten, corded up with skins, half a man’s
length under ground. So said Noche, who
had buried them. They dug; they were waist
deep, they were up to their armpits; they dug
steadily.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly there was a sound of the shovels
striking solid. They exclaimed with relief.
Noche was old, and in ten years had forgotten.
Then the diggers cleared the ground and
showed the solid country rock.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whoever had lifted the Treasure had done
it most cleverly. Every particle of the soil
removed had been taken out on skins and put
back again with filling brought ready for the
purpose, so that no sinking of the surface
should betray the theft. It had been done recently,
between the rains. On the white,
abraided bark of the pine there were splatterings
of the rapid downpour of the last heavy
shower.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Let but a few weeks of stormy weather go
over and it would have been impossible to say
that the place had been visited.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Outliers might have gone on guarding
an empty cache for generations. They
shuddered back from such a possibility like
men suddenly upon a brink. They were, in
fact, so shocked and astounded by the theft
that their faculties were all abroad. They
dug wide and furiously, Noche pawing over
every crumbling clod with a whimpering
sound like a hound at a fox’s earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>High up as the place was, higher ridges
made a pit of it which now, as the light receded,
they flung full of blackness. On the
combe above, the young pines were black
against pale twilight, dancing and deriding.</p>

<p class='c010'>Night-eyed as the Outliers were, they dared
not risk the loss of the faintest clue by trampling
heedlessly. The theft and the cunning
manner of it pointed to one thing—the Far-Folk.
On that point they were sure; and on
one other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The King’s Desire was gone, it should come
back again. They swore it. One of them
lifted up his hand to take the oath, as the custom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>was, by the honor of the Maiden Ward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop!” said Prassade.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not know what things leaped together
in the man’s mind, what circumstance but half
observed, what weakness of his blood yet
unconfessed, what scrupulosity of honor.
“Stop!” he said, and the swearer’s hand
slacked limply. Mancha propped it up
fiercely with his own.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the honor of the Maiden Ward,” he
swore, “it comes back again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Prassade gurgled in his throat. In the gray
light as they looked at each other, it grew
upon them that the loss of the Treasure meant
betrayal. Daria, Zirriloë, the four keepers, to
whom should they apportion dishonor? From
that time, said Herman, no man looked full at
his neighbor or spoke freely what he thought
until they came to Deep Fern.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime it had occurred to me that
I was not seeing as much of Ravenutzi as was
implied in my promise to Trastevera. Besides,
I thought it might be interesting to
know what he thought of the redisposal of the
King’s Treasure. I had followed the use of
the Outliers up to this time in not speaking of
it to him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>I was sitting between the roots of a redwood
steeped in the warm fragrance and languor of
a pine forest in the spring, when this notion
occurred to me. The force with which this
idea caught me might have arisen from Trastevera’s
wishing it at that moment, or Ravenutzi’s
being engaged on some business that
made my presence advisable. Accordingly I
looked for the smith in the accustomed places,
where, in the fulfillment of his hostage, he
made a point of being unobtrusively and contentedly
about. He could be found oftenest
with Noche, the only one of the men who afforded
him an unaffronting companionship.
But this morning I could not find him in the
Fern, nor at his smithy under the fall, nor
with the fishers at the creek. It was quite by
accident that I came upon him some hours
later sitting on a stump in an artificial clearing
not much frequented by the Outliers,
since it had been a hunters’ camp and had the
man taint about it. As he sat turning over
some small matters in his hand, his brow knitting
and unknitting, the whole man seemed to
bristle with some evil, anxious intent. If there
had been flames jutting from him, green spitting
flames from eye and brow, they could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>have given to him an aspect more sinister and
burning. The mobile tip of his nose twitched
slightly, the full, gracile lips were drawn
back, bracketed by deep, unmirthful lines.
The whole personality of the man pulsed and
wavered with the fury of his cogitations,
which, when he looked up and saw me, he
gathered up with a gesture and disposed of
like a snake swallowing its skin.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the moment that his eyes lighted on
mine his look neither flinched nor faltered,
but all the evil preoccupation of him seemed
to retreat and withdraw under their velvet.
His mood yielded, as it seemed to me he always
did yield, gracefully to my understanding
and the security of sympathy. He had
been busy as I came up, with some bits of
leaves and blossoms and sticks, all of special
significance, by which the Outliers could
communicate as well as by letter. He was
tying them in a bundle, which, as soon as he
saw me, he began to untie and scatter as
though there had been no object in it but mere
employment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Seeing him set his foot on some shredded
petals of a sentimental significance, I thought
he might have been composing a message to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>some woman of his own, to her who had come
to me at Leaping Water perhaps, and destroyed
it as one tears verses written in secret.
I was quite willing to help him from the embarrassment
of being caught at such an occupation
by falling in with his first suggestion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come,” he said, making room on the
stump beside him, “it is a good day for teaching
you to be completely the Outlier that I
believe you are at heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He lifted a heap of twigs and flowers, chose
a spray of laurel and berries of toyon, with
two small sticks, one of which was carefully
measured three-fourths of the length of the
other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now what does this say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The toyon means courage, but taken with
the laurel probably means a place where they
grow together,” I answered, proud of knowing
so much; “two things of the same kind
mean time—two days—no, one day and three-quarters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say to-morrow at mid-afternoon.” Then
he considered, and added a small feather.
“And this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I was doubtful.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Speed,” I hazarded.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>He gave the two low, warning notes of the
quail, and I clapped my hands, recognizing it
as a quail’s feather.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be quick and cautious!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He laughed encouragement, and then shyly,
after some consideration, he bound them all
together with a sprig of a vine that spells devotion,
and stuck it in his girdle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“See,” he declared, “you have sent me a
message appointing a secret meeting, and I
shall wear it openly to show that, old as I am,
I am not too old to appreciate ladies’ favors.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He roughed his streaked gray hair as he
laughed again with a delicate whimsicality
that took off the edge of offence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sometimes, Ravenutzi, I think you are not
so old as you look.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, when?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just now when I came upon you. And
when they talk of the King’s Desire. From
the way you look when they talk of selling it
to secure the title to their land, I gather the
Far-Folk won’t be very well pleased with that
disposition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you expect it, seeing that it belongs
to us?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But does it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Who but our fathers brought it from the
Door of Death? It makes no difference with
belonging that the Outliers have kept us out of
our own so many years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If it comes to that,” I said, “it doesn’t seem
to me to belong to either of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was ours in the beginning. Be sure it
will come in the end to our hand again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was that what you were thinking about
when I came up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose so. I often think about it. An
ill subject for a good day.” He rose up to
dismiss it. “Let us go and see if the spring is
full.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We went up through the tall timber
through a chain of grassy meadows, little
meadows planted fair with incense shrub and
hound’s tongue and trillium. We nibbled
sprigs of young fir, surprised birds at their
mating and a buck pawing in the soft earth.
I do not remember if the spring was full or
not, but I recall very well that as we came
back skirting the edge of under-grown forest,
stiff with stems like a wall, Ravenutzi made
a great to-do because he had lost my token.
That was singular to me, because a little time
before when he helped me over a bog I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>seen it sticking quite firmly in the crossing of
his girdle. He would not go back to look for
it, insisted rather that we should go around by
the Laurel Bank where toyon grew, and gather
its belated berries to make another. So being
very gay about it, and laughing a great deal,
we got back to camp with Ravenutzi’s belt
stuck full of laurel and toyon, the last hour of
the morning. This was about the time the
treasure diggers, setting three of their party
on the faint trail they had found, turned back
toward Deep Fern.</p>

<p class='c010'>They arrived about two hours before sunset,
went straight to Persilope, talked with
him apart, remained otherwise separate and
uncommunicable. Already some invisible
warning of their approach ran about the basin
and drew the Outliers in from whatever business
they were abroad upon. They came
hurrying and crowding into the long narrow
meadow between the creek and the wood, fluttered
and full of questioning. The unexpected
return of the party, empty handed, the lessening
of their number, their grave silences,
Noche’s distracted appearance, Mancha’s head
held high, Prassade’s hung down; all these
kept enquiry and supposition rife.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>The wood began to resound with calls,
which were answered from far and near as
the belated ones came hurrying from fishing
and hunting and isolated huts. In the middle
meadow the treasure hunters sat together on
the ground. Persilope walked up and down.
Around the edge of the wood ran the whisper
and jostle of fresh arrivals. Now and then
Persilope took note of them, awaiting the last
impatiently for the time to speak. The sun
traveled seaward, and the fan-spread, vaporous
rays of blueness ranged through the redwoods
and melted into twilight. The noise of
coming fell off by degrees, and every man
began to count and question to know for
whom they waited. It appeared the Maiden
Ward was still abroad. She had gone that
afternoon with the one keeper and two women
to the ridge behind Deep Fern to dig certain
roots for dyeing. She was late returning.
Two or three stars had come out in the twilit
space when far back under the redwoods there
was the sound of a man running. The <i>pad,
pad</i> of his feet on the thick needles drew near,
burst upon us, cleared the ring of listeners and
carried the man full into the open, gasping
and panting.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“Gone! Gone!” he shouted. “Lost! Seized
and stolen!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The words, sharp and startling, brought all
the sitters to their feet like the cracking of a
whip.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who? Who, and where?” cried Prassade,
taking the man, who was the fourth keeper,
by the shoulders and wheeling him round face
to face. “Is it my daughter? What have you
done with her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone!” he declared again in the midst of
panting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of her own will? When? In what direction?”
With every question Prassade shook
him as if he would have jolted the answer out
of him in default of words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me breathe. Just now. I came as
fast as I could. Not of her own will, I think.
There were others—one other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man struggled with his agitation. Persilope
counseled patience; the hearers closed
round him in a ring, as he grew more coherent.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were out, he said, on sodden ground
along the foot of the Laurel Bank, he and the
two women digging roses. Zirriloë strayed
along the lower edge of the Bank. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>a toyon bush, full berried, grown up among
the laurels, and she gathered the scarlet clusters
for her hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had been a long time pushing close
among the branches, reaching for the handsomest
berries, some thirty paces from them,
but never out of sight. They could see her
dress among the leaves. Yes, they were all
sure of that. He could not say how long it
was before it occurred to them as strange that
she should stand there so long in the toyon.
Nor how long after that it dawned upon them
that it was not she but her dress which they
looked at hanging there in the chaparral,
stirred by the wind. One of the women went
to look, and found the Ward’s outer garment
stuck shoulder high among the branches.
They thought it a prank at first, bent back the
boughs, peering and calling. Beyond the
close outer wall of foliage the thicket was
open enough for careful passage. They
pushed into the thickest stems, suspecting her
in ambush. One of the women some paces
ahead, beginning to be annoyed, searching
rapidly, spied something slipping from hollow
shade to shade. She made an exclamation
of discovery which changed to fright as a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>shot out from the laurels in front of her and
disappeared. They had all seen him crouching
and running under the low branches up
the slope.</p>

<p class='c010'>They had spent little time after that looking
about them. It was already dusk in the
chaparral. The speaker had left the women
behind, and come on rapidly to send some one
younger on the darkling trail. He turned
toward the girl’s father as he spoke, as being
naturally the most interested. I could see
Prassade’s face set and harden with the narrative,
the line of his mouth thinning. Now it
widened to let out two sharp questions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you see any sign of struggle or capture?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a leaf disturbed, not a twig broken,
but indeed we went only a little way——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sort of a man was it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was dressed as an Outlier.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” The trap of Prassade’s lips went
shut again, he had got what he waited for.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you did not think him one?” It was
Persilope took up the question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was very dark under the laurels; he ran
fast.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was he Far-Folk?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“So the woman thought.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I could see in the dusk the lift of Prassade’s
shoulders, and the slight inclination of his
palms outward. He had had all that day and
the night for wondering what his daughter’s
part in the theft of the treasure might have
been. Perhaps—who knew?—some unadmitted
fact had gone to the shaping of his conclusion.
He turned to Persilope, and his
voice cracked with hardness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me,” he said, “we have affairs
more important than the flight of a dishonored
girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, by the Friend!” cried a man, one of
those who had gone with the Treasure party.
“It seems to me that it is all one affair, and
we shall find the girl when we find the King’s
Desire. They have gone together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this, which was the first announcement
of the loss so plainly intimated by the demeanor
of the party, there ran a sound of unbelief
and bewilderment around the camp.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone!” they cried, and “Gone! The King’s
Treasure!” in every accent of incredulity and
surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay, gone,” said Prassade, “seized, stolen
away,” unconsciously repeating the words of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the keeper, “gone with my honor and the faith
of the Outliers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While the keeper told his story the listeners,
in the manner of crowds, surged forward,
closing between him and the dispirited Treasure
party. At Prassade’s admission of his dishonor,
they were disrupted suddenly by sharp,
explosive sounds which I knew for the rapping
of Mancha’s hammer. At the instant of
the keeper’s announcement I had seen him
rise and gird himself, beginning to look about
like a man missing some necessary thing, too
perturbed to recall just what he wanted. One
of his young men slipped his hammer into his
hand, and at the feel of its familiar handle a
little of the strained look left his face. Then
the crowd swallowed him in its eagerness to
hear what Prassade and the keeper said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now as the circle broke back from him and
the sound of his whirling hammer, I saw the
pale blotch of his face and hair distinct in the
twilight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Persilope,” he said, “take what measures
you will for the recovery of the King’s
Desire, but this is my business. Here should
be no talk of honor or dishonor, but simple
outrage. A man of the Far-Folk has crossed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>into our country and stolen the Maiden Ward.
Let no man put any other name to it until I
have brought her back again. But first bring
me the smith. Before I go I would ask of him
how it is, while the hostage stands, men of his
breed have trespassed on my borders. Where
is Ravenutzi?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The crowd turned upon itself. They had a
system, though I could never understand it,
by which they could locate and account for
the tribesmen when called upon. Now on
Mancha’s asking, the rustle and movement began,
hesitated, and grew rapidly into a deep
excited hum of resentment as the word passed
from group to group that Ravenutzi was not
among them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>X<br /> <span class='large'>THE LEDGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Between the morning and the
dead hours of night I was awakened
in the hut, feeling Evarra’s hands
go over me lightly as squirrels’ as
she gathered up her belongings.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you doing, Evarra?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Making ready.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Child, the Ward is stolen and the Far-Folk
have taken the King’s Desire, and you
ask me that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that sound I hear, Evarra, like a
wounded creature?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the mother of the Ward.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It hurts to hear it; may I go to her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You! What could you say to her? Besides,
it is better for her to have her cry out
before she comes where her man is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Prassade?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“Where we must be at mid-morning, at the
Ledge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Mancha?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where he should have been this month
past, at River Ward. It was there the stealers
came through.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you any word?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Before the Council parted a message came
from the trackers who had found a sign. The
stealers went through by Broken Head. Sleep
now,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>I heard the light scrape of her feet on the
threshold, and I lay still at the bottom of a
pit of blackness, from which at unutterable
heights I could make out a point of light or
two cut off at times by the indistinguishable
stir of boughs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Between the trees the lights of the Outliers
illumined the space under the shut branches
faintly as the lights in crypts that show where
the bones of saints are laid. I lay revolving
in my mind all the circumstance of my coming
here and of my connection with the Ward and
Ravenutzi. Suddenly there flashed forth, like
a picture on a screen, the incident of that letter
which I had helped Ravenutzi to make.
The token he had worn so gaily and lost so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>unaccountably. It had been a true message
dropped conveniently for one who waited for
it, and I grew sick and hot in the dark thinking
how he had used me. I must have dozed
after that, for I thought the sound of crying
increased outside, and it was no longer the
Ward’s mother, but the tall woman of the
woods who called me by my name to upbraid
me. A moment later it changed to Evarra
calling me awake.</p>

<p class='c010'>As yet no beam shone or bird sang; I saw
the shapes of the women blocked indistinguishably
in the mouse-colored mist. I
watched them, by that wild faculty of theirs
for covering their traces as the fox covers
its tracks, draw, as it were, the surface of the
forest over all the signs of their occupancy.
They strewed dry, rotting fern above the
caches, leaf litter where the hearths had been.
When I rose and went out to them, Evarra
touched my bed with her foot once, twice, and
it was no bed, but the summer drift about the
roots of trees. As we went hillward silence
spread behind us in the meadows and took the
place with desolation.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the ridge between Deep Fern and Deer
Lake Hollow the women with young children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>turned off toward some safe, secret center,
there to wait word from their men. Evarra
and the more active women kept on to the
Ledge. I went with them, not being wanted
very much, but because in the hurry of Council
no other provision had been made for me.</p>

<p class='c010'>To understand all that went on in the next
few weeks, it is necessary to be precise. Deep
Fern is as far from Broken Tree as a strong
man can walk in twelve or fourteen hours,
walking steadily, and the Ledge is ten hours
from Deep Fern. It runs, a great dyke of
porphyry, with the contour of the hills, at the
upper limit of tall trees and makes a boundary
between Outland and the Far-Folk. Beginning
and end of it I never saw, but from a
place called Windy Cover to River Ward I
knew it very well. In this place it passes over
shallow, stony soil, in which nothing grows
more than knee height, except on the lee side
of one strong hill where a triangular space of
lilac and toyon reaches quite up to the rocky
wall. The chaparral is tall enough for a man
or a deer to walk in it upright. Certain small
winds forever straying and whirling here,
ruffling the tops of the scrub and stirring the
branches, make it possible for such a passage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>to take place unobserved. The stir of a man
moving through it, indistinguishable from the
running movements of the wind, gives the
place its name of Windy Covers.</p>

<p class='c010'>From here the Ledge goes East, high and
impassable, following the hills until it reaches
the gap where the river comes through. There
it leaves off for a crow’s flight, and the river
continues that boundary until it touches the
Ledge again. The whole of this space being
thickly wooded and the river running shallowly
at seasons, it was here the Far-Folk
trespassed most. Here past the end of the
Dyke the filchers of the King’s Desire had
come. The whole region was known as
River Ward, and Mancha kept watch over it.
Beyond its second point of contact with the
dyke, called Broken Head, the Ledge went on
south a very great distance. I never heard
how far, though from something that I heard
at Windy Covers I gathered that the Outliers
possessed all the district south as far as the
Sur. Just beyond Broken Head the river
widens and makes a turn where there is easy
passing, called from the sound of it going
over the smooth stones, Singing Ford. All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the other places I have named lay north of the
river between it and the Ledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>We came to Windy Covers a little after
midday. I should have said, looking up its
green steep, level grown as a mown field, that
all the Outliers were there before us. The
tops of the scrub were all ashake; the lilacs
tossed, the buckthorn turned and whitened.
Lines of wavering showed in it like the stir of
a meadow when rabbits run in the grass. But
it turned out to be only the wind walking for
we were hours ahead of the men.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, I told you it was good cover,” said
Evarra, as we came in by the green tunnels
that the deer had made.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had gathered from the talk of the women
that we were to lie there, guarding the pass,
and keeping out of River Ward. Mancha
was occupying that section now, hoping not
to excite the Far-Folk by too active pursuit.
It was not known yet if the lifters of the
Treasure had passed beyond River Ward or
if Ravenutzi had joined them, if indeed he
might not yet be on our side the Ledge with
the Ward. There were some other points in
this connection on which I wished to satisfy
myself. So when I saw Lianth mousing along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>under the wall, I crept after him, unsuspected.
We came into a little bay of bitten
scrub and a well-trodden track that led up
along the stony, broken back of the Ledge.
This way the bucks had gone when at the end
of the mating season they ranged afar and fed
on the high ridges. This way they came down
to seek the does, and along this trail I saw
Lianth pawing breathlessly, nose to the thick
mosses like a snuffling hound.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They must have come this way,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” I assented, thinking of the deer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If they have crossed, there should be some
trace of them. They must have come in the
night and could not have gone so carefully.”
He scrutinized little heaps of leaf litter in the
crevices, and squinted along the ground. “And
the trackers have not been here either. They
cannot have crossed at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All at once I understood that he was talking
about Ravenutzi and the Ward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no other way,” he said, “no other
way possible for—a girl.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lianth, where is Herman?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He left off pawing over the trail and
walked on toward the rim of the Ledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone after her.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“Zirrilëe?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mancha sent him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why should he take so much trouble? She
went where she chose. You heard what the
keeper said?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah!” he cried woundedly, “you women
are all against her!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We had reached the top of the Ledge overlooking
the Far-Folk country. It was all
rounded, grassy hills, stony, full of shallow
hollows, with occasional depressed trees, lying
in the thin, airy shadows that fall so singularly
in high places. It was very still, two or
three crows flying over, and far up under the
blue a buzzard sailing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s no use looking out for them,” objected
Lianth. “They’ll not show themselves while
we are here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think they know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Huh! Do rabbits know when coyotes
hunt? If they know about the King’s Desire
what wouldn’t they know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was sitting on a heap of stones picking
the moss out of the crannies and pitching it
down below. His throat and chin were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>strained and tight as though no songs could
come that way again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I think of her hands,” he said, “and
the parting of her hair, as white as a dove’s
egg&nbsp;... if she loved anybody she wouldn’t
have thought of anything else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Evidently she didn’t,” I insisted cruelly.
“But why do you care so much? Even if she
hadn’t run away with Ravenutzi it wouldn’t
have been you she would have married, it
would have been Mancha.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To look at the boy you would have said his
songs were not all dead, one of them rose and
struggled to go the accustomed way, and it
was a song of boy’s love and wounded trust.
He bit it back at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mancha was the only one good enough for
her,” he choked. He was done with the moss
now, and was aiming small stones carefully at
empty space. “I would have wanted her to
have the best.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At any rate she took what she wanted.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood up, flushed and tormented.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re just down on her because Herman
is in love with her,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know.” He scuffed the moss with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>his foot and added, “You can always tell if
you’re that way yourself. I don’t want to talk
about it any more,” walking away from me.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently he came back stiffly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must come with me,” he said; “you
can’t stay here. I was told to look after you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What time did Herman go?” I asked as
we went down together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just after Council. Mancha wanted to go,
but they said his place was at River Ward. If
he had been there all this time the Far-Folk
mightn’t have got through. They let Herman
do what he liked, because if it hadn’t been for
him they wouldn’t have found out about the
stealing so soon. And look here”—he showed
me a spray of toyon berries—“I went and
found this after the trackers had gone. I felt
around in the dark and found it. It was the
last thing she touched. It was only half broken
off. She hadn’t expected to go away; she was
surprised and she left it half broken off.” He
put it up in his tunic again. “I don’t know
why she went away with Ravenutzi, but I
know she never told him where the Treasure
was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was so certain of that, I had no heart
to trouble him with doubts. As we came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>down the trail we saw the top of Windy Covers
all alive, rippled and streaked with motion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some one is coming,” Lianth volunteered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It looked just like that this morning. How
can you tell?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I can’t tell that. I knew how just before
you asked me. The way I know Zirriloë
didn’t tell Ravenutzi about the King’s Desire;
I just know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was, in fact, some of the Outliers who
had not been at Deep Fern, drawn from their
own places by that mysterious capacity of evil
news to spread. They came hurrying all that
day and the next. The Covers were peopled
thick as a rabbit warren. Coveys of quail
whirred up from it with a sharp explosive
sound and broke toward the wooded land.
Except for that, and the fact that the quail did
not come back again, there was no sign. Men
sat close in the tunnels, and it was dreadful to
see the working in them of their resentment of
betrayal. So much the worse because they
knew it had been half invited. They had accepted
a hostage of the Far-Folk, who never
spoke straight nor did truly. What wonder,
then, if he had done after his kind? They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>knew—at this point resentment rose to its
burningest—they had always known, and
knowing, could not have done otherwise. Ravenutzi
came under honorable conditions, and
they had served him honorably, being so much
the debtor to their own natures. They were
not only sick to be dishonored, they sickened
of dishonor. As they sat in the green glooms
of Windy Covers their bodies heaved and
flushed, eyes reddened, hands wrenching at
invisible things. Now and then, at the mention
of a name or a circumstance, some quick,
explosive breath would struggle with a curse;
the gorge of the spirit rose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Never among the Outliers had I found myself
so unfriended. I felt myself burned upon
by their rages, but they cared nothing for my
burning. To have harped upon my own resentment
was to advertise myself a witness of
their betrayal. I judged best to be as little in
evidence as was compatible without making
myself a target for the Far-Folk. I found
myself as lonely as could well be expected.</p>

<p class='c010'>Late of the second day I went down to the
edge of the chaparral where the trees began
to invade it, standing apart and singly, and the
chaparral had made itself small to run under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the trees. I found an island of dry litter under
a pine, and drew myself up in it, out of the
pervading bitterness and betrayal, flooding so
fiercely under Windy Covers.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was incredibly still here; neither bird
hopped nor insect hummed. The shadows
shook in the wind. I sat with my head against
the pine and my eyes closed. By degrees I
thought the wind increased and drew into a
long whisper which was my name. This fancy
comforted me with the notion that whoever
abandoned me, the wood was still my own. I
heard it several times before a crackling in the
bushes aroused me. I turned to observe another
woman struggling anear through the
thick stems of manzanita. As she crept and
wormed toward me she drew on to her knees
in the open space under the tent of the pine.
Then I saw that she was the tall woman who
had loved Ravenutzi. I saw more than that;
she had come to me through great difficulty
and by hard ways, her dress was torn, her
hands scratched and bleeding, her hair, which
was bound under a leathern snood, disheveled.
But whatever her difficulties, they had
not marred her so much as the passions that
wasted her from within. She was more beautiful;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the long, flushed throat, the red, scorning
lip, the eyes darkened and hollow. But
she was so plainly gnawed upon by grief that
as we knelt there, I half risen on my knees and
she on hers confronting me, I could feel nothing
but pity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You!” I whispered dryly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Speak low,” she said, though indeed we
had done nothing else, so did the stillness of
the place weigh upon us. We were completely
isolated in a ring of shadow, the chaparral
coming up to the outer boughs of the pine,
and the fan-spread branches meeting it a foot
above our heads.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have waited for you all day,” she whispered.
“Tell me, have you found him?
Where has he taken her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not know. We have no trace of
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But which way did they go? From what
point did they leave the Meet? Something—surely
you know something?” She clasped
her cut palms together, and I saw a slight
flinching at the pain they gave her. She cast
it off impatiently as though it were an interruption
to her understanding.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Tell me first what you are to him, that
you should ask?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“His wife!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You—so young——”</p>

<p class='c010'>I had an instant vision of Ravenutzi’s white
hair, and then as I had first seen him washing
his hair at the pool of the Leaning Bay. At
the recollection, and perhaps a slight flicker
of amusement in her face, the two things
leaped together in my mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was that also a pretence?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are herbs which will bleach the
color from the hair and draw the skin in
wrinkles,” she said. “He had more years
than I, but we were young.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the hostage, too, was it all a pretence
from the beginning?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What else?” impatiently. “The King’s
Desire was ours, and we schemed to get it
back as we had first won it. I was as willing
as the rest when we began. If I was not to
see him again for three years, that was my
part of the service, and I was proud to pay it.
But I never thought of this. Oh no, never
this!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She crept up to me and eased the strained
position of her limbs.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“I will tell you everything,” she moaned,
“if you will only answer me. Ravenutzi was
to make friends with the Ward, and seduce the
secret from her. We were to lift the King’s
Desire as soon as known, and nothing was to
be said or hinted until the hostage was over.
Then if they discovered the loss, who could be
blamed for it? He was to stay the full time
of the hostage, for if he came away violently,
they would suspect, and go and look to see if
their Treasure had been moved. I knew, or
thought I knew, that if he got anything from
the Ward she would have to love him. I
thought he could manage it. He is very wise
in women. Even you——”</p>

<p class='c010'>I checked her there; it was evident the Far-Folk
were acquainted with everything that
went on at Deep Fern, but I was not going to
discuss my part of it with Ravenutzi’s wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had never heard, then,” I broke in
upon her, “that the Outliers chose their most
beautiful young woman to be the Ward?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I had heard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She put up her hands to her face in some
quick, indefinable shame. I suppose Ravenutzi
had contrived to keep her convinced of
the supremacy of her own loveliness.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“When the Treasure was safe in our hands,”
she said, “then we heard that the House-Folk
had persuaded them to show the King’s Desire
and it was certain that the lifting of the Treasure
would be discovered. We did not think
it would be so soon, but we sent to bring Ravenutzi
away. We were sure he would be killed
when the Treasure party returned. While the
Far-Folk waited, word came that Ravenutzi
had gone to make the Ward safe in some secret
place and would join us shortly. That was all.
No word to me——” Anger swallowed up
her speech.</p>

<p class='c010'>I tried to soothe her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was the least he could do if she had told
him. The Outliers would have killed her had
they found her out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What matter to him if they had? We have
killed Outliers before now when it was a question
of the King’s Desire. Why should he be
so careful of her, unless—unless he loves her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the anguish of that conviction she struck
with her wounded palm against the tree, and
sinking her head upon the arm that Ravenutzi
had rested on, with what bliss it gave her the
keener anguish to remember, set her teeth in
the bared, tender flesh. I let her be, writhing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>like a wounded snake, for a time. Then, as
the best cure, I began to tell her with particularity
all I could recall of the flight of the
smith and the Ward from Deep Fern.</p>

<p class='c010'>She questioned as she listened; would have
me be precise.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had never been any nearer to Deep
Fern than the place where I had found her
the second day of the Meet. Could she reach
it easiest from here by way of Leaping Water
or otherwise? Just how far was the Laurel
Bank from the long meadow, and how could
one get at it? I could see the purpose grow
in her to strike that trail and follow it to whatever
end. She listened and hardened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me well how she looks,” she said, “so
that if I find this flagrant girl I may not mistake
her,” and I saw her blench as I named
the points of the Ward’s beauty. She jerked
and quivered. Little sentences escaped from
her like phrases of a delirium, of the utterance
of which I think she was unconscious.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Little fair hands,” she said, “a trivial heart&nbsp;... hair of two colors&nbsp;... a snare, a snare&nbsp;... a crumpled lip goes with a false tongue&nbsp;...” Her jealousy kept pace. “Kill her,
would they?... Let them&nbsp;... does he think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>to keep her who could not keep her word?
Does he lie safely with this false Ward while
his people wait for him at——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop!” I said. “I have told you all that
concerns you personally, as one woman to another.
But I advise you, I am on the side of
the Outliers, if you say anything of value to
them I shall not keep it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She bit her lip.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do I know of what the people do in
my absence, or where they foregather? It is
of him I think; does he imagine me waiting
in my house like a faithful wife——”</p>

<p class='c010'>She threw out her arms, rocking on her
knees.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... “Long, oh long, have I been gathering lilies!...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I do not know whether she uttered these
words in the delirium of her jealousy, or if
something in the anguished gesture sent the
refrain of Ravenutzi’s song sounding through
and through me. I heard it shaken like an
organ somewhere above the sound of tears.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... “Long, oh long, have I been gathering lilies!...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>She stood up as well as she could under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>bent pine, to draw her dress into order, and
asked me who had gone on the trail of Ravenutzi.
I named all the men, and then Herman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He too!” She looked at me with curious
mocking. “All the men are mad, I think. Now
I have a mind to go and see what this girl is
like who sets all people by the ears, and when
I have found her I shall come to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She smiled sidewise whimsically as she
stooped to the chaparral again. Though there
was inordinate hate in her look and insuperable
hardness, there was that in her fierce, tormented
spirit so laid hold on me that I neither
put out my hand nor raised my voice to stay
her as she went.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>XI<br /> <span class='large'>HOW THE OUTLIERS CAME UP WITH THE FAR-FOLK AT A PLACE CALLED THE SMITHY, AND HERMAN CAME BACK TO RIVER WARD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Nothing in all that struggle initiated
by the lifting of the King’s
Desire, pleased me so much as the
way the Far-Folk outstretched
themselves by their own cunning. They had
chewed the cud of the old grudge so long, disgorging
and regorging, that life smacked no
other savour for them. They made the mistake
of imagining no other among their enemies.
That slow treachery of Ravenutzi’s,
while it burned against the honor of the Outliers,
kept the habit of treacherous thinking
alive among their enemies. The Far-Folk
wasted themselves upon the method and left
not much to reckon with beyond the fact of
possession.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let them once get their hands upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>King’s Desire! They asked no more than that,
planned very little more. Communication
with Ravenutzi was difficult. Never greater
than the time of the Meet from which they
hoped so much, when the thought of the
Treasure was uppermost in every man’s mind.
Then hope overrode precaution and drew
them, when they had most need to keep in the
dark, to cluster just beyond River Ward like
wastrels above the water where the dead are
about to rise. There, had he not had other
business for his thoughts, Mancha should have
discerned them. But the Hammerer’s preoccupation,
though it saved them from detection
by increasing the sense of safety, hurried the
unearthing of the King’s Desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>News of this move only reached the Far-Folk
as they lay all together, with no preparation
for flight or siege, in a shallow cañon back
of River Ward, humming with excited talk,
like a hive about to swarm. The mere hint of
frustration fanned them into a fury, which was
succeeded when the Treasure was actually in
camp, by gross, babbling boastfulness and exultation.
Close on this came word from Ravenutzi
that he had fled the Outliers with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Ward, and they were to await him in a place
called the Smithy.</p>

<p class='c010'>If they wondered why he should have taken
so much trouble for a girl who had already
served her turn, they had either less interest in
his relation to her, or trusted him more. What
did concern them was that the same message
told them that by this time the Outliers were
in a fair way to discover the loss of the King’s
Desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>They judged they would be tracked and
planned their defense in keeping with what
they thought the Outliers’ probable estimate of
themselves. They reasoned that the Outliers
would be expecting lies in the enemy’s country.
They left a boy behind them to watch.
If the Outliers lost the trail he was to run and
bring the Far-Folk word. If they struck the
trail to the Smithy he was to turn them from
it by the simple truth. There they overdid
themselves. The Outliers, not yet inured to
lies, believed what the boy told them.</p>

<p class='c010'>They caught the boy—one with some spirit
in him meriting a better employment—crawling
through the scrub half a day beyond River
Ward, and brought him before Persilope,
where he scratched and cursed awhile and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>then fell sullen under their questioning. Let
them kill him, he said, but he would not tell
where his people were, nor how to get at them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nay, we will not kill you, lad,” Noche reassured
him, “we love you so much.” Here
he wrapped his great arms about the boy,
handfast behind his back as the captors had
brought him in, and lifted him against his
breast.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So,” he laughed, “will you not tell me for
love where the Far-Folk are?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.” The boy’s face flushed purple, the
breath came whistling through his teeth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One,” said Noche, and the muscles of his
back began to swell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two,” said Noche.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes-s-ss!” sung the boy’s rattling breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>And when Noche, who would have cracked
the ribs of a grown man as well, set him down,
the boy staggered and was sick, and admitted
they were at the Smithy. He had been entirely
within his instruction in that, but he
must have seen the unwisdom of telling the
truth as he had been instructed, when the
Outliers set out immediately in that direction.
His distress was evident and genuine, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>moaned and whimpered, came fawning to
Persilope.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, what ails the boy?” said he, perplexed.
“We want no more of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, oh, I have lied to you,” whined the
lad. “I have lied; you will kill me when you
learn how I have lied. They are not at the
Smithy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, oh, I do not know. Over there. At
Eagle Rock, perhaps. But certainly not at the
Smithy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His anxiety undid him; Noche came close.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall I say three to you, my youngling?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy fell silent and shivering. All the
rest of that journey Noche kept him serviceable
by the mere motion of his arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>The place called the Smithy lies in the pit
of a blind cañon, all of rusty red volcanic
stone. Half-cooled it seems, smudged black
with smoke, encrusted with flakes of dark
lichen like soot. Some Junipers grow there,
wind depressed, all asquat above the rocks
like dwarfed, warty things crept out of the
ruins to take the sun. In the middle of the pit
half a score of pines staggered together as if
awry with labor at the cold forges. Here the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Far-Folk repaired to wait the smith and gloat
upon his work. Here, when the earth melted
in its own shadow under a sky of dusky blueness,
whitening to an unrisen moon, the Outliers
found them. The Far-Folk had eaten,
and sat about on the broken stones gloating.
Even in repose, and from the top of the hill
where the Outliers looked down at them, they
had the attitudes of exultation. The King’s
Desire lay uncorded in their midst, the little
low fire struck a thousand bright reflections
from it. Red eyes of gems winked from behind
a screen of golden fret. At the head of
the circle sat the chief of the Far-Folk, and
the Cup of the Four Quarters was between
his knees.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Oca was a lithe man, well bronzed, of
a singular, wild, fearless bearing; he had a
beard of thick, wavy locks that he blew back
from his lips as he talked, accommodated to
the carriage of his head like sculptor work.
Around his mouth there was the evidence of
something half-formed, undependable, the
likeness of half fabled wood-creatures. In his
eyes, which were bright and roving, and on
his brow, there was the witness of extraordinary
intelligence. He had a laugh, short and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>bubbling, that came always at the end of his
words and belied their seriousness; it was as
if some sardonic half-god sat in him and
laughed at his assumption of being a man. He
laughed now as the Outliers looked down on
him, lifting the Cup of the Four Quarters,
blowing back his long lip locks to drink.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Outliers had come, I say, to the top of
the cañon at dark, for they had not been very
sure of the way, and had scorned to squeeze
further help from their captive. They hung
there straining through the dusk to take the
lay of the land and for the moment forgot the
lad. He must have had some good stuff in
him, for all that afternoon he had been white
with high resolve, when they thought him
merely frightened. The Outliers’ party halted
where the coiled and undulating strata flowed
down the sides of the cañon like water lines in
old bas-reliefs. Under the wiry trees they
made out sparkles of red and green and figures
moving. Just then the boy managed, by
slipping on a pebble, to bring his throat a foot
from Noche’s hand and to let out a cry formless
and anguished, breaking off in mid-utterance
like a trumpet torn asunder. To it succeeded
the sound of a limp body dropping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>among disjointed stones, the rush of the Outliers
going down, and the scuttling of the
Far-Folk in the blind gully like scared sheep
in a runway.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was very quickly over. The cry had
done its work and the advantage of the ground
was all to the Far-Folk; dark people as they
were, the dark befriended them. When the
Outliers loosed their slings the first sound
took them into cover. There was heard the
crack of the sling stones followed by sharp
groans, but by the time our men got down to
the twisty trees there was not a spark of the
Treasure nor one of the Treasure lifters. They
stumbled on some of the Far-Folk women who
had lingered to wake the sleeping children,
and took them, with a good part of their baggage.
By the time the moon came up there
was nothing to be seen of either party but one
slim body of a lad, with his back broken,
growing cold in a deep cairn of stones.</p>

<p class='c010'>Persilope moved on with the slingsmen to
keep the trail of the Far-Folk warm, and
Mancha, who preferred the work that promised
earliest news of Zirriloë, came back with
the captives to River Ward.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the early half light, as they traveled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>they were aware of a tall woman with long
hair blowing, who came and stood on a hill
overlooking them for long enough to have
counted all the captives. When she had told
them over, she wrung her hands and bit upon
them, and vanished into the morning mist. I
supposed it must have been Ravenutzi’s wife.
She was still looking for some clue of him and
had not found it.</p>

<p class='c010'>We moved, all of us, from Windy Covers
that day to a place beyond the Ledge, but near
enough to the Gap for us to fall back upon
our own country if need arose. That night,
before Mancha got in from the Smithy, Herman
came back again. It was the pale end of
night, the moon was gone ghost white, and the
wind was awake that runs before the dawn.
I was lying sleepless in my bed under the
buckthorn when I heard the whisper of their
arrival on the far side of the camp.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had said to myself that I owed Herman no
welcome. Though there was no personal tie
between us, there was in our common condition
of aliens among the Outliers an obligation
to look out for me, which he had no right
to neglect. Here was I left to he knew not
what pains and inconveniences while he ran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>after this wild girl and a faithless, dishonored
man. The more I considered this, the less of
satisfaction it brought me. For whatever the
pitiableness of the girl’s case, and I felt there
might be something in that, it was no affair of
Herman’s. Why should he set himself beside
her and against all other women who had kept
right and true, by what pains and passionate
renunciations I seemed now to feel myself
seized and participated. I saw myself with
the others affronted by any excusing of Zirriloë.
That my friend should so excuse her
pointed and made personal the offense.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was so sure of this resentment, and it was
so palpable a barrier in my own mind to the
renewal of intimacy, that when Herman, before
he had eaten or rested, came stealing
among the stretched figures, I could not imagine
what he was looking for. He crept with
long, stooping pauses where an arm thrown
up or a drawn cover concealed an identity,
until he came to where I lay, wrapped in a
cougar skin under the buckthorn. Then I
knew by the full stop, and by the long breath
of easement after strain that it was I he
wanted.</p>

<p class='c010'>He sat down a very little way from me, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the hillock of a broken pine. Though I could
not see his eyes in that light, I made out that
his face was turned toward me, and that he
leaned it upon his hand. Whether he felt some
emanation of my resentment and was troubled
by it, or whether from weariness, he moved
uneasily and sighed. He must have grown
more accustomed to the dark by traveling in
it, for presently he reached out to brush lightly
some small twigs and leaves that had fallen
on my bed, and felt or saw the barely perceptible
stir I made.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mona?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did I wake you? I did not mean to. Do
you wish to sleep again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not asleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I suppose he expected some question which
would give him leave to begin with what his
mind was full of, but I had already heard the
whisper, handed from bed to bed. I guessed
what ill success the expedition had, and I had
no wish to hear Herman’s part in it. I lay
still and made out the faint movement in the
leaves of the buckthorn, until, by the slow
clearing of the dark, I could see the droop of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>his figure with fatigue, and I was not proof
against that.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very tired; why do you not go and
lie down?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you don’t mind I would rather talk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He moved over nearer and seemed to get
some comfort from my proximity, for he began
without any further encouragement.</p>

<p class='c010'>Herman, he said, had not kept close to the
Outliers but with Mancha had scouted far to
the left in the hope of coming on some trace
of the Far-Folk’s secret camp, where he imagined
Zirriloë might be hid. They had followed
fruitlessly on faint clues, and finally
with no clues at all, and had come to no conclusion
except that the fugitives must be still
on the Outlanders’ side of the Ledge. The
track had gone far north of Windy Covers
and there was no other passage known for so
great a distance as to be impracticable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a way,” said I.</p>

<p class='c010'>And as soon as I had said it I was overtaken
with a swift certainty. This secret way by
which Ravenutzi and the girl had gone must
be the same one the wife had come through
with her torn hands, venturing so much to
ease her need of him by talking to me. I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>so struck by the idea that, by just the time she
had taken to wait for me at Windy Covers she
had missed seeing Ravenutzi help the girl
tenderly over that same trail, that I began at
once to tell Herman about it, to his great
amazement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did that,” he said; “you talked to her
and let her go, knowing what harm she had in
her mind to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She was a desperate woman; she could
have killed me before help came if I had
given the alarm. In any case,” I protested, “I
would not have given it, because she trusted
me. But no harm will come to the Outliers.
This is a private quarrel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That poor girl,” he said, “if she should
find her!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In that case,” said I, “would you back
Ravenutzi to back his wanton or his wife?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mona—you have no proof!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You said—the day she came out of the
woods by Leaping Water—that she was the
sort to do anything for the man she loved.
Well—she is that sort.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mona!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps it was not for love then. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>said she could appreciate—things. Perhaps
Ravenutzi promised her a——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mona! Mona!” he said, with so sharp an
anguish that if I had not felt I owed it to all
honorable women to show him where he stood,
I should have left him to his dear illusion.
Yet to see him so excusing treachery for the
sake of a tinted cheek or the way a wrist was
turned, set me white hot and throbbing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you rather,” I said, “she had done
it for love, or for the King’s Desire?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I could not see his face, but his voice was
troubled with amazement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mona—I—I was not prepared for this.”
It was too dark to see, but I guessed the pauses
to be the swallowings of his throat. “I thought
you would be glad to have me go to that poor
girl and make things as easy for her as I could.
You never seem to think how she must have
suffered before she came to this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She hid it well. And depend upon it, Herman,
whatever sufferings a woman has in such
a case, whatever struggles, they are <i>toward</i>
the thing she would do, not away from it.” I
do not know how I knew this, but the moment
I had spoken I was quite sure. “If she
struggles,” I said, “it is to justify her right to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>do it, to quiet compunction, to appease her
fears. Zirriloë came to the end too quickly
to have suffered much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We were both still after that, while the
heavens whitened and showed me a little of
how worn he was and what marks of the trail
were on him. I suppose he must have felt the
melting of my mood toward him, for presently
his hand stole toward me and began to
finger the loose end of my cougar skin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You never seem to think, Mona”—he hesitated—“what
this might mean to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, what does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I tried, I think I tried, not to make my
voice sound so yielding that he should suppose
me softened toward the shame and wrong
of it, nor so hard that he might imagine the
hardness grew out of my caring what it meant
to him. I must have fallen a little to one side
or the other, for it was a long time before he
began again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know,” he said, “I am hardly sure
myself. There was a time before we came to
Outland—how long ago was that, Mona?—when
I fell short of much that you said and
thought. There was something in books and
poetry and music, especially in music, that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>were always expecting me to understand, and
the expectation irritated me. I fell into the
way of denying and despising that something,
and trying—I am afraid succeeding, too, in
making myself feel that it sprang from some
superiority in me not to understand.... Are
you listening, Mona?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Herman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was not that I felt the want of it so much
in myself, but other people—you, Mona—missed
it in me. There was a door to all that,
about to swing upon the latch&nbsp;... and I could
never swing it. And then we came to this free
life&nbsp;... and Zirriloë.... Did you think I
was in love with her, Mona?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Were you in love with her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know&nbsp;... she made the door swing
back&nbsp;... she had such a way of walking&nbsp;... and
that little smile of hers coming and going&nbsp;... she was all those things made manifest.
A man would understand. I liked to do things
for her. It was a way of serving all the loveliness
of women&nbsp;... it was serving you, Mona....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah,” I said, “I would have understood
better if the service had been paid in person.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>He was both humble and reluctant in his
acknowledgment, and paused so long a time
after it that I could mark the ebb of the dark
from the highest hills and the full slopes
emerging rounded with verdure. But I found
I had nothing to say to him in all this, and
perhaps he expected nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If she could have stayed so&nbsp;...” he began
again, “as long as she stayed so, I could feel&nbsp;... what was it you used to say?&nbsp;... the
roll of the world eastward.... But to have
it end like this&nbsp;... in meanness and betrayal&nbsp;... I wish I might have brought her back
with me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better that you did not, considering what
she would come back to meet. If she
loved Ravenutzi she is having her happiness
now. If she suffers at all it is not for what
she has done but for what you may think of
it. And if there is any deep-felt misery going
on in this anywhere, it is on the part of Ravenutzi’s
wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, I had forgotten there was a wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I meant he should not forget, nor lose for
that shallow girl any of the deeper opprobriousness
that should attach to the double
betrayal. But I was taken by surprise to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>him turned by that suggestion quite in another
direction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A desperate woman, by your account of
her,” he said. “Promise me, Mona, that you
will not hold any further communication with
her, and that you will not go out of the camp
without an escort. It isn’t safe, and it isn’t
quite fair, is it, to parley with the enemies of
the Outliers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>If he had stopped with the consideration
of my safety, I should probably have consented
meekly like any woman when any man
takes an interest in her, but that suggestion of
unfairness set me at odds again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not do anything imprudent,” I
said; “but as to the relation of my behavior to
the Outliers, that is a matter which you must
leave me to decide for myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose so,” said Herman ruefully. “I
beg your pardon. I don’t know how it is,
Mona, I let other women do pretty much as
they like with me, but I always find myself
getting irritated if you don’t do exactly as I
say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I was certain Herman had never said anything
like this to me before, yet it had so
familiar a ring to it that I found myself going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>back in my mind for the association. I recalled
what Evarra said when she asked if
Herman was in love with me, that if such
were the case he would expect me to do as he
said. I was so taken up with this possibility
that I heard not too attentively the far cry of
coyotes going by. There must have been some
nuance in it not of the beasts’ cry, for the Outliers
began springing up around us, listening
and intent. It came again and one answered
it. By such signs we were made aware it was
Mancha returning from the Smithy.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>XII<br /> <span class='large'>HOW AN OUTLIER SAW A TALL WOMAN FOLLOWING A TRAIL AND MANCHA MET THE SMITH AGAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>I have no notion how long we lay in the
neighborhood of River Ward. By this
time we had lost all track of the calendar,
Herman and I, and the Outliers
had none except the orderly procession of the
season’s bloom and fruit and mating time.
Great umbrageous clouds came up behind the
hills and were cut down by the wind. Clear
days succeeded one another, matched so perfectly
for warmth and color that the consciousness
took no account of the dividing nights.
Crowns of foothills lying seaward showed
increasing green and then faint flecks of
poppy color. These were our quietest days,
for though there was fighting and following,
Herman and I had no active part in it. Consider
how few we were in a great land, and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>trumpeting, no shock of guns, no daily bulletin.
Ten men would set out on the mere
stirring of an animal sense that beyond a certain
hill or in a known hollow lurked the
breeders of offense. And then no news of them
except as they came or did not come again.
Companies of Far-Folk and Outliers would
fence all day each to come at the other unsuspected:
flights and evasions and sharp encounters
took place in such deeps of leafage
as dulled all sound. All this was covered,
swept over as carefully as the wild creature
hides its ways.</p>

<p class='c010'>Often now, walking on the tawny-colored
hill that sleeps above the bay with the Mission
between its paws, I look back at the warm-tinted
slopes, beyond the reach of the encroaching
fogs, and wonder under what peaks,
between what long blue ranges we lay that
season. What tumult and warfare goes on in
those still spaces unregarded? But we have
never, as I said in the beginning, got any
nearer to it than Broken Tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Outliers stuck to the track of the Far-Folk,
and had so much the better of them in
readiness and organization that before long
they had captured the most of their women.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Under Mancha our men had sought out their
homes, abandoned so hurriedly, in the shallow,
brush-grown cañons, and had burned and
broken what they found. That Ravenutzi had
joined the Far-Folk we knew, for once when
they had come to parley over a wounded man,
they saw the hostage at Oca’s back directing
the Council by such knowledge of the Outliers
as he had acquired by long residence. Oca
blew out his long beard, laughing as he
listened.</p>

<p class='c010'>I knew too from one of the captive women,
that he still concealed from his wife the place
where he had hidden the Ward. The explanation
Ravenutzi had given to Oca of the use
he should make of Zirriloë’s person in the
game that was yet to be played, set that chief
chuckling in his beard like a cataract.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to his wife Ravenutzi had denied seriousness:
laughed, kissed her burned throat,
blinded, bound her with an ingenuity of
charm and tenderness until she grew tame under
his hand. Then she would rage the more
bitterly when he was away, suspecting him
with the girl in hiding; flaming with jealousy
until his return found her burned out, white
and faint, creeping humbly to his caress.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>This, I say, I had from one of the captives,
for I talked of her to the Outliers only with
Trastevera. I think the woman’s story was
known to them. She was seen often flitting
from some post of observation when they came
with prisoners, and though it was certain she
had been twice inside the Ledge seeking the
place where Zirriloë lay hidden, no motion
was made to take her. They judged her no
doubt hunted by a more remorseless enemy;
the same that drove on Mancha’s trail and
wasted him in the night. It was strange to
me at first when I looked on the Hammerer’s
passion-hollowed face, to see how it was contradicted
by the youthful fuzziness of his
blond hair and the round stalwartness of his
frame, until I realized that he tried to make
his body what his hammer was, the instrument
of his satisfaction, and nursed it carefully to
that end. But here the invisible enemy had
him at point. Eat he could, and bathe, and
exercise himself and rough the handle of his
hammer to his grasp, and tighten the thongs.
But in the night sleep and jealousy contended,
and he turned in his bed and set his teeth upon
his hands. His eyes reddened at the lids, and
when he would be sitting among us, his attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>would be forever wandering, and
there would be a half inadvertent movement
of those same hands as if to rend and tear. It
was plain that he came but half out of some
burning preoccupation to attend to whatever
his men brought to his notice, and slipped
back into it even between the utterance of two
words, like a drowned insect in a glass. He
was seldom at River Ward, seeming easier to
be on the trail and in action. That there was
only one trail that interested him was perfectly
evident. He cared nothing whatever
for the recovery of the Treasure if only he
might get at Ravenutzi and find where the
Ward was hidden. And as often as Outliers
and Far-Folk came together in running fights,
his men fell apart tacitly to afford him the
craved-for opportunity. As we knew afterward,
by Oca’s express direction, the Far-Folk
closed round the smith to oppose him.
As often as Mancha came back unslaked, his
new whetted fury turned on himself. Bitter
as these frustrated encounters were, they were
less so than those times when they surprised
their enemy and found Ravenutzi not with
them. Where was he then but lingering in
some shut quarter with the Ward! One would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>know that this had occurred when the Hammerer
sat upon the edges of his bed the night
long goading himself with recollections.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give over; give up,” cried Trastevera to
him. “She never thought of you; and what
do you but suck poison from the thought of
her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what,” said he, “shall I think of, if
I do not think of her? Do you advise me to
think of <i>him</i>?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Think of your work, how you are to win
back the King’s Desire for us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And how shall I think to win the King’s
Desire and not think of how it was lost?” And
so having worked round in a circle again he
did think of it; what looks and sighs and wooing
touches had gone to that betrayal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I could get at him,” he cried, “if I could
only get at him”; and groaned and struck with
his stone hammer deep into the soft earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was difficult for Trastevera, who alone
partook of his stormy confidences, to be patient
with his consuming thought, since she
was herself the happier, free of the obsession
of Ravenutzi. For the Outliers remembered
now how she had been against him in the beginning,
and blamed themselves for overriding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>with their weighty reasons that delicate
presentiment. Warmed by this support, all
her power of foreseeing put forth again and
promised them success. She burned with foreknowledge
that kept time like a poised and
constant needle with what went on afar behind
wooded hills and in secret valleys. Often
as we lay in the chaparral and heard the bees
fumble at the flagons of the wild currant, and
saw the young rabbits rising to drink delicately
of dew in the shallow cup of leaves, she
would start up bright and hot, sniffing battle.
As she drooped and grieved, or snatches of
triumphant song burst from her, we guessed
what went on between our men and Oca’s a
day’s journey south and west.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in that quarter they defended themselves
for as long as enjoyment of the King’s
Desire exceeded all other considerations. It
was a region of high hills, set close, well covered;
narrow cañons choked with chaparral;
rain-fed springs, trailless steep barrancas.
Here they kept like foxes, quick and slinking,
and the Outliers hunted them, not often with
success. The cover was too thick for slings,
and the ways too steep to give free play with
the hammers. The enemy showed themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>and ran, involving the Outliers in a maze
of blind gullies, and came out unscathed and
mocking on hills above them. They made
elaborate false clues and set traps which at the
last moment they wanted the courage to
spring, but never came to any open issue because
of the King’s Desire. They had the
Treasure in hand at last, and could not be persuaded
to leave it. Where it was they hung
like flies at a honey-pot. You could never
find the Far-Folk very far nor very long from
one another. They would have out the jewels
and gloated upon them, tracing the patterns,
holding them this way and that to catch the
light, tried on the collars and the armlets,
pranked in the crowns, fed upon the mere
sight of them as an antidote to defeat. All
this was very well for a time, but the drawing
of their forces together about the King’s Desire
served their enemies more than it served
them. Threescore men in a camp were easier
hunted than two or three. By keeping in close
order they left betraying traces in the forest,
and brought down Mancha’s hammerers. To
avoid this they made longer flights, swift, uncalculated
leaps. Their women and children,
unable to keep up with them, were gathered in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>by the Outliers and carried to River Ward.
It began to appear that they must make temporary
disposition of their trove until they
had possession of their families again, and
could make off with both into that wooded
country south where there were no man traces
and no Outliers could come.</p>

<p class='c010'>They buried the Treasure once, and then
the whole party sat upon the place like brooding
quail, and betrayed it by their guarding.
So they had it up again, and Ravenutzi and
Oca made a plan between them. They were
to send the jewels on south under convoy,
then by means of the person of the Ward they
were to draw Mancha off from River Ward.
Then with a free field left the main body of
the Far-Folk were to raid the camp at River
Ward and recapture their women.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the plan: An old man was to have
himself captured by Mancha’s men in order to
convey to the women news of the rescue waiting
them. The Ward, who lay still in some
secret place of Ravenutzi’s contriving, was to
be brought up to that quarter where it was to
their advantage to have Mancha get word of
her. A good plan, and worthy of the smith
who planned it. It was well agreed to except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>in one point. No one of them trusted another
one to take away the Treasure. So after much
argument they fell upon the notion of dividing
it. It was evident that as long as it remained in
the common custody, no man was free to fight
and run, according to his fighting humor or
his chances. But give every man his own to
carry about with him and he would know
what he was fighting for, not with one eye
over his shoulder to see how the common object
fared. Good logic and sound, answering
in many a better case; singularly not in this.
Settling on a division of the King’s Desire
proved a much easier matter than dividing it.
They were two days wrangling over the manner
of the division, and another trading and
bargaining and matching lots among themselves.
Then followed the period of inaction,
planned to give the Outliers the impression
that they had withdrawn from that part of the
country. The next move was to have the
Mancha sent seeking in the direction where it
was to be made known through the captives
the Ward was to be found. Ravenutzi had
gone to prepare her for her part in it. Poor
child, if it were willingly or not, if she consented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>at all, or even if she had any clear idea
what was required of her, who can say?</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime there were the Far-Folk
lying separate, very quiet, every man with his
treasure in his bosom to finger and fondle,
with the south open before him and the spring
coming on by leaps and bounds. Everywhere
there were the smell of sap, the mating cry of
quail and poppy fires kindling seaward; not
much to put the fighting humor in a man.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Outliers were not quite in the same
case. They were wronged, robbed, betrayed,
they distrusted every move of their enemies,
kept watches out. From the meeting of the
river and the Ledge to the Gap, where the dip
of the ranges east began, there was a line of
solitary outposts, patrolling all the passages.
While the Far-Folk played fox in the thorny
covers south, there was in reality a stopped
earth between them and their women and the
places they had known.</p>

<p class='c010'>The posts beat eastward half a day each
from his own station to the next and back.
One of these, going as still as a snake, saw a
tall woman with long, coiling hair wrapped
about her body, wasted and lovely, following
a track in the woods. She followed so patiently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>and with so much intention and such sureness,
poring above it as though every footprint
stabbed her and she hugged the stabbing
to her breast; urged forward on it with such
anguished purpose, held back from it by such
torturing fears! Who else but a jealous woman
follows in such fashion on the trail of the
man she loves? The Outlier counted himself
a poor guesser if this were not Ravenutzi’s
wife following Ravenutzi. He followed, too,
at a discreet distance. He might, perhaps,
have come alongside her without attracting
her attention, so intently was it fixed upon
what lay before her, what she could not
withhold herself from seeking, and was afraid
to find. Now she hurried on with a kind of
fury of discernment. Now she turned aside
to compose her anguished bosom the better
to read its traces where the trail looped and
turned to baffle and bewilder. He followed.
Trees gave place to scrub, and that to knee-high
chaparral, and that to open hill crowns
and broken stony ledges. Here he must skulk
behind hills and at a considerable distance,
because of the betraying openness. Presently
he lost her. He had made sure that she was
headed for a certain sag in the crest of a hill,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>and that by coming around the brow of another
one he would have full sight of her
again, that he was astounded and chagrined
to discover, as it seemed, that she had sunk
into the earth. There was no cover and no
woman. Below him lay a slight hollow full
of loose boulders. Toward this the trail, if
trail there was, must have led, and he would
have hurried on except for being so sure she
had not had time to make it. He lay still
where he was, under the jut of a bald hill, and
considered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently he saw a fox come out of its hole
on the opposite side and begin to trot across
the hollow; it started between tall boulders,
but swerved, went sidewise, muzzle pointed
with suspicion. Within the ring of boulders
then lay something that was neither stick nor
stone. From his post the watcher could not
say very well what it was until the shadows
had shrunk by about an hour. And then he
saw the woman. She lay flat, face downward,
waiting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you wait, my girl,” said he to himself,
“it is because he you follow is at the end of
his trail and returns upon it soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Outlier saw the tortured woman writhing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>with impatience, saw the shadows shorten
toward noon, and crows flying over, and then
he saw Ravenutzi. The smith came over the
sag of the hills, walking steadily, with apparently
nothing on his mind but to get on to the
place where he was going. He passed the
woman lying among the boulders. The Outlier
saw her crowding her face in the dust as
he went by, as if she feared she must have
cried out and run to him if she had looked.
He passed the hill where the watcher lay, and
struck into his former trail, deeply cogitating,
looking neither down nor about to discover if
he had been followed. When the smith was
quite out of the hollow the woman rose and
ran the way he had come, and the watcher
considered. He thought most likely the Ward
was at the end of that trail, but he had no particular
interest in her, it was Ravenutzi who
bred mischief and must be looked after. Accordingly
he kept the smith in sight. As they
passed the neighborhood of River Ward going
back, the Outlier whistled one of his fellows
out of the wood and sent word to
Mancha.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was how it happened when the Far-Folk
came together to have their last direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>from the smith, that there was an Outlier
tracked him quite to that place. Behind him,
following a slot of bent twigs and broken
leaves, were Prassade and Persilope with the
slingsmen and Mancha with the hammerers.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was late of the afternoon and the light
low enough to dazzle in the eyes. The place
was rather level and open, with thin-branched
pines and scant fern; behind it a sharp hill
breaking abruptly. Oca sat below the hill
where a glade opened, and the thick locks of
his beard, heavy and waved like sculptor’s
work, were gathered in his hand. He had on
his head the circlet of fire-stones that gleamed
as he turned, red, blue and green like some
strange insect’s eyes. His body was half bare
and his arms from the elbow up were banded
with circles of beaten gold. The smith whispered
behind him, and as the chief nodded,
the eyes of his circlet changed from blue to
green and red again as though they took their
color from his thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>Around stood the Far-Folk, eager, pleased
with themselves, more interested in the cunning
of their scheme than anxious over its
success, making the necklets and armlets to
shine on their dark skins. They laughed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>boasting together like boys, then crowding one
another to stillness to hear what went on
among the leaders debating round Oca with
some show of order. Half girt they stood,
pluming themselves upon the morrow, the
ring of unguarded backs turned outward.
And in the midst of this came a sharp winging
like the flight of birds—but no birds so swift—and
a heavy pelting as of hail—but no hail
tapped so loudly on the trees or thudded so
sickeningly on human flesh. The outer ring
of the Far-Folk surged toward the middle
and there was a rush of those within outward,
and then the pleasant wood was full of racing
figures and hurtling noises.</p>

<p class='c010'>It had come so quickly and from so many
quarters, the light shining so low took the
Far-Folk so squarely in the eyes, that the best
men of them must have known from the beginning
what the end was to be. After the
first scattering rush they formed a ring about
Oca and Ravenutzi, and then the curse of the
King’s Desire began to work. Standing so in
close order they made a better mark for the
pelting of the slings. Such punishment as
they had from the slingsmen was not to be endured.
Had they had any reason for keeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>their close order, they might by sheer weight
have broken through the ranks of the Outliers,
thinned to enclose them. But they had broken
up the Treasure and had no other motive for
holding together; they broke scattering, and
Mancha’s men dealt with them singly as they
came. There was heard the rapping of the
slings, like the snapping of coals in the fire,
and after the slings left off the hammers began.</p>

<p class='c010'>Always as the ring about Oca melted into
the scuffle and disorder of the fight, the Outliers
followed the shine of Mancha’s hair as
he ate like flame through the ranks toward
Ravenutzi.</p>

<p class='c010'>I suppose the smith saw him come and
saved himself for what was before him; at
least no man saw him strike a blow until his
time came. The Far-Folk had edged the old
king forward through the press, keeping toward
a clear cañon down which they hoped
to get away. But at the last Oca saw a son
of his lifted high in Noche’s arms, one hand
cast up like a crest, squealing with anguish.
Back the old chief leaped, avoiding the whirling
hammers, leaving the smith uncovered.
Oca’s men rushed to defend him, and Mancha’s,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>wheeling to prevent it, carried the fight
to another quarter. The sound of the struggle
receded from Mancha’s ears, filled with the
rushing of his own blood as he came face to
face with Ravenutzi.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the fighting mass cleared away and
left them so confronting one another, the advantage
seems to have been all to the smith.
He was unwinded and wary. Mancha was
hot and driven, hate rocked him where he
stood like drunkenness.</p>

<p class='c010'>They looked each upon the other for two or
three short breaths, and Ravenutzi took a
slight step backward. It was in reality to
bring him in a better position with the light,
but Mancha mistook it for flinching. With
a cry he rushed upon him, whirling his stone
hammer. The smith parried and thrust.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hammer struck glancing, the smith
reeled from it and dropped his pike. Mancha
threw away his weapon and took the swaying
body in his arms. He was head and shoulders
shorter, but the lift of his back was tremendous,
and Ravenutzi was dizzy from the blow.
Mancha had him down. The long legs and
arms of the smith clung and bound him; they
were down together and up again and down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>rolling and writhing, as they turned in a heap.
Mancha was aware of one of the Far-Folk
running toward them frothed with rage,
weapon lifted, but he would not loosen his
hold nor look away from Ravenutzi. He expected
a blow from behind, and then he heard
the shock of men coming together that told
him how the blow was intercepted. He had
the smith down now and under him, and
struggled to loose the binding arms. He heard
a voice calling: “Mancha! Mancha!” and
thought it was the voice of Lianth. Too young
to come to battle, the boy had been allowed by
Mancha’s friendship to run between the creek
and the fighting men to bring stones, as they
might be needed, to the slingsmen. Once he
had heard the whistling of the slings, the lad
had come bounding like an unbroke hound to
bay around the skirts of the fight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mancha! Mancha!” said the voice, “I
have him. He shall not get you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good lad!” said Mancha, but he would
not look away from the smith’s eyes lest he
should lose the hint of motion in them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mancha, Mancha, I am hurt.” He heard
the sounds of mortal agony in the fern, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>they were not louder to him than the coming
and going of his own breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hold him,” he said to the voice behind
him. He had his knee on the pit of the smith’s
stomach and the arms were loosening.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mancha!”—the voice was nearer—“he is
dragging me. I cannot——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mancha had one of Ravenutzi’s arms twisted
under the smith’s own body and his own
hand at the smith’s throat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mancha! Manc——” The voice broke
with a bubbling sound.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had the smith’s windpipe under his
thumb, he was shaking him and grinding his
head into the earth. A hand from behind
clutched upon his heel. He kicked out and
heard a wet cough, followed by a groan, but
he could not turn to see what came of it. He
shook and wried the smith’s head as it blackened
under his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is she? Tell me where she is,” he
cried, short and gaspingly. With every repetition
of the word he lifted the smith’s head
and ground it into the earth. He saw surrender
in the bitten tongue and the protruding
eyes. He rested a little, but as yet he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>not spare the time to look behind him. Ravenutzi
came slowly back to consciousness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me where she is.” The answer came
thickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Far from here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where, where——” There was a motion
of the choking and grinding to begin again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can I tell you?... in a place known
only to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I let you up will you take me to it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Breath,” said Ravenutzi, “give me
breath.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mancha let his throat be while he bound
the man’s arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you promise, smith?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that across my feet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A dead man, I think.” Mancha glanced
slightingly over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is my king?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Prassade has taken him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And my friends?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of them is across your feet; a lad of
mine killed him. I do not know where the
others are, it is some moments since I heard
fighting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is all to you, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All to us&nbsp;... <i>you dog</i>&nbsp;... if I let you up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>she is?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will take you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But it was not until Mancha had bound and
rebound him that he left the smith to go and
turn over the stiffening body of Lianth and
wipe the bloody froth from his lips.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>XIII<br /> <span class='large'>HOW THEY FOUND THE RUBIES, AND THE SMITH’S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>News of the fight reached River
Ward before midnight, but before
that, about dusk, we heard Trastevera
singing, walking up and down
on a low hill scented and white with gilias,
hymning of victory. And after I had lain
down in my accustomed place I heard the
women all about me, fevered with expectation,
rising to intimations of approach too
fine for me. From that part of the camp
where the women of the Far-Folk slept, there
arose now and then some sharp accent of dismay
and grief, succeeded by the nearly mortal
dejection of defeat. Unable at last to bear the
night so full of noises and suspense, I rose and
walked to the edge of the wide, bush-grown
shallow where the Outliers were camped and
met Herman coming to find me.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“Do not go where the women are,” he said;
“the wounded are there, and besides, they do
not want us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Very softly we skirted the edge of the swale
and climbed to the foot of a knoll overlooking
it. Some oaks grew here, and the prostrate
trunks were strong to lean against. The moon
was gone on her last quarter, and the figures
of men moving in the swale were large and
vague against it. There was a wind stirring
that kept up a whimpering whisper in the tops
of the chaparral. It took the voices as they
rose through it and rounded them to indistinctness;
only by listening attentively could
we distinguish between the acclamations of
victory and cries of loss and pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But tell me,” I insisted to Herman, “you
have been among the men, have they brought
back the King’s Desire?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look,” he said, “at that man moving there
as he turns against the moon; do you see the
line of light that runs about his forehead?
And there! what glitters on that outstretched
arm? Hardly a man of them but has some gold
about him, but they have not said a word.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And who has the Cup of the Four Quarters?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“Noche took it from Oca’s son; I saw him
studying it by the reflected moon, but when I
came up he hid it in his bosom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the great rubies?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They have not come in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Herman,” I said, after a long pause, “what
do you think they will do with it—and us?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The King’s Desire? Bury it, I hope. With
us? Do you know, Mona, I am no longer
anxious about what they will do to us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; they have been good friends of ours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor afraid of the Cup,” finished Herman,
“for I have come to feel that I have found
something here in Outland that not even Forgetfulness
can take away.... What I said
to you the other night&nbsp;... the door....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I thought it was Zirriloë....” He
stopped and considered. “... And that she
had shut it again on cheapness and affronting
shame.... It left a mark on me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Such experiences do, Herman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But she is gone&nbsp;... and the door swings
wide. It is open to-night; and that is what I
have found here in Outland that I shall never
let go again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>What he really had was my hand, which
he seemed not to be aware of, beating it softly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>between his palms as he talked. I could
hardly withdraw it without seeming to point
an emphasis.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And being so sure of <i>that</i>,” said Herman,
“makes it difficult to believe that all this
should be taken away from us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He made a gesture with the hand that held
mine toward the swale of River Ward, the
silvered line of the willows, the low moon, the
fair light, the smell of the packed earth breaking
up to bloom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know, it is very strange, Mona, I
have not the least idea where we are, but I
think I could start out to-night direct for
home and find it. Have you ever felt so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not since the Meet at Leaping Water.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But to-night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-night I feel it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How far away the Outliers seem to-night.
Look down there in the hollow, there is not
one stirring. How could one say there is now
any grief or captivity down there? Mona, do
you really believe there <i>are</i> any Outliers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, I’m good at believing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The moon dropped down behind the hill
till there was but one shining jewel point of it
winking on the world. The chill that comes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>before the morning began to temper the air
and I shivered under it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are cold,” cried Herman; “wait.” He
slipped away in the scrub and brought back
skins in which he wrapped me. “Have you
had any sleep at all to-night? Where is your
hand, Mona?” He drew it through his arm.
“Now, if you will lean back against the oak
here, and against my shoulder, so: now you
may get some rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I leaned against the oak and touched his
sleeve with my cheek. I had not meant to do
more than that, nor yet to sleep, but the oak
swayed a little comfortingly, so still and soft
and dark the night was—suddenly there was
the morning freshness and Trastevera calling
me awake.</p>

<p class='c010'>I saw the dark green of the earth shining
wet, the faint, ineffable green of the dawn,
and between them spread a veil of silvery
mist. Down in the hollow the Outliers were
all astir; rearward two lines of men moved
toward the Gap. I saw them disappear in the
willows and emerge again in the stream
rounding the point of the Ledge. They walked
mid-thigh in the turbid water and braced
themselves against the force of its running.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>I saw the lines bend and right themselves like
the young willows. These were the Far-Folk
moving under guard toward Leaping Water.
Below us as we came down the knoll were
Mancha, Prassade, Noche and some others,
with one in their midst whom, as they turned
and looked toward us expectantly, I recognized
as Ravenutzi. He looked dry, I thought,
and stripped. His glance, which took me
dully, when at last it was aware of me, appeared
to turn inward for an instant as if to
call that old excluding charm of personality.
I felt it flicker and expire. But all that group
continuing to look toward us curiously as we
went down, I enquired of Trastevera what it
meant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is Herman,” she said. “They wait for
him. Mancha has asked if he would like to
go a day’s journey with them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will go,” I answered for him, for I
knew at once whither that journey tended,
and what they would find at the end of it. To
this day I do not know what prompted Mancha
to invite him. Whether he thought the
opportunity due to him who had first gone on
the trail of that unhappy girl. Whether he
had some inkling of Herman’s state of mind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>and divined in him an excusing understanding
of his own hopeless infatuation, I do not know.
At any rate he would not set out on that day’s
business without Herman. That was how we
learned what happened in the Place of Caves,
half a day beyond Windy Covers, and as much
as was ever known of what had occurred between
Ravenutzi and the Maiden Ward, no
maid by now, and in a more inviolable wardship.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were afoot nearly all of that day, for
besides having far to go, the men were stiff
with battle. They traveled in this order—first
Ravenutzi, limping a little, and Mancha
stumbling close upon his heels. Neither of
these spoke a word more than necessary the
whole of that going. Then came Prassade,
who groaned at times and made a gesture with
his hands as though his heart were torn out of
him and he saw it there in the trail and
trampled on it with his feet. Next Noche,
muttering in his beard and seeming at times
to rehearse the incidents of battle, lifting and
hugging somewhat in his arms and shaking his
huge shoulders. After these came Herman
and the men, among whom was that one who,
following the tall woman, had found the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>smith and betrayed the Far-Folk to capture.</p>

<p class='c010'>They came behind the others a little distance
and whispered at times among themselves.
They talked of Mancha’s fight with
the smith and how Oca went mad with rage
bestriding the dead body of his son, striking
so furiously with his pike he could not fetch
it back again, and how Prassade had taken
him from behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>They told also how the women of the Far-Folk
had come in from some bleak hilltop
where they hung like buzzards, and surrendered,
asking no privilege but to tend their
wounded. Once it occurred to Herman to
ask if Ravenutzi’s wife was among them, and
the men said no. At that Herman and Mancha
looked at one another and the same
thought was in the minds of both but they kept
it to themselves. About an hour after midday
it began to appear that they had done wisely
in bringing with them this man who had followed
Ravenutzi’s wife. The smith seemed
determined to mislead them. He wished to
turn out of his earlier trail very far to the
right, and could not understand why this man
protested so much nor why Mancha paid any
attention to him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“This is the way,” he said; “who should
know it if not I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the Friend, smith, it may be your way,”
said the man, “but it was not the way your
woman took following your trail, and I hard
upon hers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You saw that?” cried Ravenutzi. “A
woman, my wife, following me to—to the
place where we are going?” Herman said it
was the first time he had seen Ravenutzi beside
himself; he grew gray, a film came before
his eyes through which the pupils opened,
blank pits of horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You saw that,” he cried, “and you let her
go!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah,” said the man, “but I judged you the
better game.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ravenutzi twisted like a man on a rope. He
set off running.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is the way,” he said, “it is shorter so.”
And the rest ran on to keep up with him. They
came in this running fashion to the place of
the boulders where the woman had lain face
downward in the dust, and passed over the
sag in the hills where she had been last seen
disappearing. Beyond this was stony country;
great boulders huge as houses lay all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>a-heap at the foot of a steep ridge. Smaller
stones and rubble from the slope had drifted
down and choked the upper crannies between
the boulders, so that under them were windy
galleries and spacious caves. There was no
game nor foodful plant, only coarse tufts of
grass between wide stones, nothing to draw
men, only shelter and safe hiding.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they came near this place, Ravenutzi
began to go more slowly, forewarned perhaps
and afraid of what he should find there. He
raised a call, cautiously at first, got no answer,
called loudly, grew anxious, set off running
again, the men hard behind him. The place
fronted westward; the shadows retreating inward
gave to the caverns under the rocks a
shallow look. The men could not have told
from the outside which of them would have
yielded passage, but Ravenutzi plunged into
one, which proved an arched gallery. It
opened into a sort of court, from which a
water-worn gully led steeply up to a ledge on
which opened a cave, overhung and guarded
at the entrance by fire-blackened stones. They
were slow enough going up this steep, to observe
a woman who sat at the mouth of the
cave with her knees drawn up under her hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>and her head bent upon them. They saw that
she was tall and had long hair that coiled flatly
about her throat and between her breasts.</p>

<p class='c010'>She looked up from her knees as they
climbed and clustered on the narrow platform
before the cave. There was neither astonishment
nor fear in her eyes, only weariness, as
of one who has accomplished what she has
long sought and found that after that nothing
mattered. Some color sprang in her face
as Ravenutzi stood before her, the faint tinge
of expectancy. But he never looked at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where, <i>where</i> is she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Ravenutzi who asked, and got no answer
except as by the turning of the long
throat she indicated the cave behind her. Resting
her head upon her knees, the tall woman
went on looking quietly at nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The floor of the cave sloped downward. It
was low at the mouth, and the men stooped
going through it. It was large and airy, and
had been hung with tawny and dappled skins;
some light broke through high crannies in
the roof and showed them in the midst of
these the Ward. She was very beautiful. The
sparkling masses of her hair drifted out on
either side the cameo face. Over the eyes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>that were brown like agates at the bottom of
a brook, the pale lids half drooped like the
rims of snow that lie along brook borders in
the cold. She was partly dressed, the bosom
bare, and over its soft curves ran a line of
blood-red stones, wickedly a-fire on that cold
breast, tremblingly, shiftily alive in the light
that sifted through the crannies of the rocks.
Around the throat and in the hollow of the
bosom they led the eye down where they melted,
and ran in redness and spread dully on
the floor, still wet and dripping.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was so moved by that sight, Herman
said, and for the moment so little believing
in it, that he had no realization of how the
others looked at it nor what they might have
felt. He was first roused to take note of his
companions by seeing the smith turn from the
body with a movement of deprecation, and
the sudden swinging of Mancha’s hammer into
position. He heard it click as it rose against
the roof of the cave. He heard an exclamation
but could not tell for the life of him
whether he himself had not uttered it; and
then he saw the hammer caught from behind
by the girl’s father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mine,” he said; “mine, not yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Prassade was as fierce upon the point as if
some one had denied it: his the greater offense,
to him the punishment. Then as quietly
as Mancha’s hammer dropped, the wrath of
Prassade fell off before the unimpassioned
quietness of the Ward. Stillness seemed to
rise from her and crowd them out of the narrow
chamber into the overhung and guarded
entrance where the woman sat winding and
unwinding the long coils of her hair. They
did not look at the Ward again nor back at
what Prassade did; it was a relief to watch the
woman. She stood up and her head was high,
her lip was bitten red, two spots of color
glowed upon her cheeks. She looked at Ravenutzi
as a child might who has broken a
delicate thing and refuses to be chidden
for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The place was too small for us both,” she
said, and then after a little: “I thought you
would never come,” with a gesture of weary,
ineffable tenderness. “Oh, I thought you
would never come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She was all alive to him and very beautiful,
so flushed and so alive you could not understand
that death could be so close behind
her. All the rushing of her blood and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>swaying of her slender figure demanded of
him what, even with death behind, he could
not deny. He took her in his arms. He put up
his hand to turn her face on his shoulder away
from the hard eyes of the men. But he could
not conceal as he did so the flush upon his own
and the tremor of renewal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever the girl had been to him, she was
now the evidence of how much his wife had
loved him; as much as <i>that</i>! It was a declaration
which shamed him by its publicity
but purchased him anew to passion and protecting
tenderness. They stood so, she superbly
conscious of her right to a place she
had cleared for herself, and he still shielding
her. Nobody spoke a word. Behind in
the cavern Prassade put back the dead girl’s
hair from her soiling blood and covered up
her breast. Presently he called Mancha, and
the others by one consent moved down the water-worn
way, out of the sound of their sorrow.
Ravenutzi’s arm was still about his wife.
At the foot of the ascent he put her from him
quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go wait by the outer caves,” he said.
“They will not wish to see you when they
come out.” And she, lifting up her head from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>his breast, went quietly, all gentleness and
submission, never seeing how the others looked
at her, never taking her eyes from him till the
boulders closed on her and hid her from their
view.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should say to you,” said Ravenutzi,
“what, perhaps, I may not have time to say
again”—for he thought then and the others
thought, that Prassade would kill him when
he came out of the cave. It was to spare her
that sight that he sent his wife away. “You
may say to the others when they are able to
hear it,” he went on, “that much you may have
been thinking of that fair child is wrong. She
never told me where the King’s Desire was
hid.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She never told,” he insisted, “not of her
own consciousness”—looking about for some
point of interest or attention to fix upon, and
settling upon some small stones which he
pushed together with his foot—“something I
had from her without her knowing it&nbsp;... but
there were others”—here, his gaze rested an
instant on Noche, and dropped to the stones
again—“... several others&nbsp;... in whose
minds the facts lay like trout in a lake for him
to make rise who was able.... Among my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>people there is great skill in this.... You
yourselves gave me the opportunity&nbsp;... all
your minds ran full of it as a creek after the
rain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked up from his stones, which he had
pushed into line as though they were a class
who could nowise hear him until they had
been so ordered. He must have found some
hint of belief in Herman’s face, for he addressed
himself to that more confidently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is true I wooed her&nbsp;... so as to have
an open road to her mind. She had no chance
against me&nbsp;... but she never knowingly told....
I do not think I could have persuaded
her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I believe the man spoke truth. For a certainty
he felt death close upon him. Whether
the men believed him or not they honored his
intention to clear the girl. Some slight easement
of their manner toward him made it
possible to say more openly:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I meant no harm to her. She had none at
first.... I brought her away because I
thought you would not believe&nbsp;... you
would have killed her&nbsp;... she came....”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stopped full at that, there was no need
to say how she came nor what believing. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>were all still together, thinking what he had
done and despising him too much to question
at all. He essayed to speak once or twice after
that, and Herman observed that look to come
upon his face which he had often remarked
there. The faun’s look, half wishful, half
defiant. A wild creature that abates none of
its creature ways, but is desirous to have touch
with man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How fine a piece of work she was,” he said.
“... The way her chin was fitted into her
throat&nbsp;... the gold fret of her hair.... I
was the smith....”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stopped; there was nothing in the faces
of the men that gave him leave to say his
craftsman’s delight in her who was to them the
injured daughter of their friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>Prassade came out presently and Mancha
with him. They looked nor spoke to no one
as they came down the gully, but each took up
a stone, walking with it laboriously, and laid
it at the cave’s mouth. Then one of the men
went and did the same, and the others, and
Herman. At last Ravenutzi, seeing no one
hindered him, took up a stone and went up and
down with them, carrying, until the mouth of
the cave was quite full. Presently Ravenutzi’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>wife, grown tired of waiting, crept back
through the stone arch and stood watching
them with red bitten lip, coiling and uncoiling
the long strands of her hair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE KING’S DESIRE, AND WHAT BECAME OF IT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The party of us that came up from
River Ward to Leaping Water
turned aside from the meadow
where the Meet had been, and settled
in one of the galleries of that amphitheater
looking down on its veiled cascades.
The shouting of the falls came up to us mixed
with the faint, incessant murmur given off by
a great forest. From here the rim of the world
sank westward into the thin blue ring of the
sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>We had come so slowly, being joined at
times by families of Outliers, come out of safe
hiding and already furnished with news. We
were scarcely well settled in the place when
word of the death of the Ward began to circulate
among them in that mysterious way of
news to travel in the open. Doubtless it came
by way of runners stationed out toward Windy
Covers, by which trail the seekers of the Ward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>returned. Rumor of it was rife in the camp
a full hour before Mancha and Prassade came
in. There was very little said about it, they
were at all times as private in their griefs as
wild creatures, but I think they felt better satisfied
to learn that the natural progress of her
betrayal had furnished its own punishment
and spared them the necessity of putting Zirriloë
to death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Herman came and told me this, walking at
dusk on an open hill where there was long
grass blowing and shut-eyed heavy flowers
among the grasses. But it was a long time
before he would talk freely of that suggestion
of excuse, put forth by Ravenutzi, which
lay in the appeal to his craftsman’s soul of
the girl’s bodily perfection. He had been no
more able to resist taking into his hand that
fair contrivance than any other jewel of gold
and fine stones, and its turning to flesh and
blood under his touch had been a bitter and
unavoidable consequence. I think Herman’s
inarticulateness grew out of feeling himself
involved in the ruin of a lovely woman in the
common culpability of men. She was a vase
which they had pulled about among them in
admiring, and dropped and shattered.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>I say I think Herman felt this, though
I do not now recall any words that passed between
us on the subject. Yet I was at that
time much nearer to understanding the beguilement
of beauty, and the pain of its bafflement
which drives men to create of words and
paint and stone, forms of it by which no confusion
can come. When I saw Ravenutzi sitting
among the Far-Folk, with his knees drawn up
under his hands and his delicate faun’s profile
bent above them, looking out at me in the old
way, at once wishful and compelling, the look
I sent back to him was almost kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whiteness of his hair had been cut away,
the drawn look of his skin smoothed out. I
saw how young he was, a little of what those
two women had seen who had been drawn by
it to death and killing. His wife sat with her
head propped against his shoulder. And for
so long as she sat there, assured, accepted, it
was plain there was for her neither anxiety nor
pained remembrance, nor any other thing.</p>

<p class='c010'>One supposes death at all times so natural
that the wound of it heals by its own processes.
It was so with the Outliers. No later than
the next morning much of the bitterness of loss
had drained away with the dark. The business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>of the Ward being finished they turned
without discursiveness to disposing of Ravenutzi,
the Far-Folk and the King’s Desire.
Though we had no inkling, Herman and I,
what would be done to the smith, we felt it
would be just; and whatever would be done to
the Far-Folk, more than kind. Concerning
the Treasure there must some command have
circulated. Though we had seen it glinting
in the camp at River Ward—there was scarcely
a man who had not brought something away
with him from the last fight—there was not so
much as the red sparkle of a jewel to be seen
at Leaping Water.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Council met early on the second morning,
going down toward Council Hollow before
the dew was dried upon the fern. All the
camp, scattered as it was in a great treeless
tract, hung in the breathless quiet of suspense.
There was scarcely any stir of talk or movement
except now and then among the Far-Folk,
who lay all together like cattle on a
warm hill slope, turning toward the sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>Herman and I, since no one seemed to regard
us, thought of going down to revisit the
meadow and the lovely open water below the
Leap. But the expectant sense that brooded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>over the camp bound us to the consideration of
what might be decided about us personally at
the Council. If we looked afar at the sea rim,
trying to make out at what point we were, we
looked suddenly back to see if the councilors
were not coming up the hill. If we heard a
lark rising with its breast all brightening yellow
from some grassy water border, we listened
the more anxiously immediately to hear
if any one had come to call us in to judgment.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the shadows were gone far toward
midday we heard what might have been the
breaking out of bird songs low and urgently
through all the open woodland. There was
a sound of feet moving all together, and then
some one calling us by name. The Council
men were coming up from the Hollow and the
Outliers crowded up to them to hear what
they had to say. They said nothing whatever
until we were all come into hearing, and
ranged, the Far-Folk on one side and we on
the other, on the crown of a hill, open, and
having a large grassy space beyond it.</p>

<p class='c010'>I thought then, and I have not since reconsidered
it, that of all times the noon is the
most solemn in which to deliver judgment.
When all the earth is quiet, shadows folded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>up, no bird singing, no beast abroad, all the
outer sense drowses under the sun glare. At
such a time to hear a voice crying punishment
and doom is more terrible than any
hour of night. A convocation of wolves in
the open sun would not have seemed more singular,
but this was not a business which could
await a gentler time.</p>

<p class='c010'>We could see Persilope standing up, all expression
beaten out of his face by the sun, like
leaf under the gold beater’s hand. Presently
when we were all well quieted, he began in a
voice pitched for carrying, but toneless as the
light, ordering some skins to be spread in the
grassy space in front of him. Then it was ordered
that all the Outliers who had anything
of the King’s Desire should bring it to that
place. The chief held up as he spoke, the circlet
which he had taken from Oca’s head; and
as he turned it in the sun, it melted and ran a
ring of changing fire. When he had done
speaking he cast it down with so much force
that the setting, which was old and delicate,
burst and sent the stones scattering like broken
coals. There was a little pause after that,
and then Noche, springing up from behind
him, held up the King’s Cup, but neither so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>high nor so steadily. A little laggard of perception,
as the very strong commonly are, the
point of what Ravenutzi had said about the
way in which he had come to learn the secret
of the Treasure, had driven slowly to the old
man’s brain. Now it troubled his countenance:
his eyes were dark sockets between the
drift of his brows and beard. He held up the
vase in his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cup of the Four Quarters,” he said, “O
Cup of Tears!” His strength surged in him
with the recollection; the bowl crumpled in
his grip, he bent back the base upon the stem
and dropped it on the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>After him came every man with what he
had; armlets and buckles and chains of
wrought and beaten gold and jewels, and
the jeweled lamps and vessels. The heap
grew; it glittered and darted pain into the
eyes; it had green and blue and ruby gleams
in it that winked and mocked the sun. When
it was all in—all but the great rubies which
lie still in a place known only to some few of
us who are not likely to go there to fetch them—and
the men had sat down again, Persilope
began.</p>

<p class='c010'>He spoke steadily and without passion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>saying what was well known to them, that
a curse was laid on whoever lifted the King’s
Desire. But the truth was, the curse lay in
the mere possession of it by whatever means;
as if one should expect to keep a viper in his
house and not himself be stung by it. Itlan
had been destroyed for it, and all those of
their own people who had kept the Treasure
since, had purchased nothing but wars and
trouble with it. All of which being within
their knowledge and true, it was agreed for
the safety of the Outliers to cast out the King’s
Desire as men would a poison snake which
they had found among the huts.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this there was a spark, a quiver of expectancy
among the Far-Folk. As if they imagined,
eyeing it so greedily, that the treasure
heap was to be handed over to them as it lay,
not so very unlike the snake of his comparison,
coiled glisteningly upon itself with red jeweled
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such an expectation, if it amounted to that,
died with Persilope’s next sentence, which
was, briefly, to the effect that for all these reasons
it had been determined that when the
Treasure was buried again, as it shortly would
be, it was to be followed by a forgetfulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>from which there would be no revival. It
was to be forgetfulness of such a fashion—here
he looked over at Ravenutzi and the
bleakness of his delivery augmented—that
there would be no picking of their brains afterward.</p>

<p class='c010'>I could see that the news of this conclusion
had already spread and been accepted by the
Outliers. It was, perhaps, in the eye of all that
had recently occurred, not strange they should
accept it with so much gravity, and on the
part of the women with some consternation.</p>

<p class='c010'>I looked over at Trastevera where she sat
close to her husband. I saw her look doubtfully;
write with her finger in the dust.
Then I saw that no Outlier looked at any
other, but down or up. I thought I understood
that though they agreed with the judgment,
no one wished to assume the responsibility
and drink so deeply of the Cup. It had
not yet occurred to me that there was any other
way in which complete forgetfulness could be
secured.</p>

<p class='c010'>I saw Persilope search his people slowly
with his glance before he spoke in a voice
heard to the outer ring.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Outliers, are you all here?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>It was followed by the rustle and murmur
by which they took account of themselves and
of those left beyond River Ward with the
wounded. The murmur, swelled to affirmation,
passed from group to group and was
handed up to Persilope by the nearest council-men.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are all here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Know then,” he said, his voice and words
shaping to formality and sounding drearily in
the white aching noon, “that there is a service
to be performed for the common good, and a
penalty to be undertaken. The Council leaves
it open to any man who loves the common good
so much, now to offer himself. Is there any
so offers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>And still the eye of no Outlier sought any
other eye, only I saw Trastevera look up from
her drawing and, leaning a little past the
others, gaze steadily toward some spot beyond
her with a long, compelling look. Before I
could follow it to its point of attention, almost
before Persilope had done speaking, I saw
Noche getting on his feet, blinking a little as
though the light abashed him, and fumbling
embarrassedly at his girdle like a child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I should be counted worthy&nbsp;... if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>could be trusted again....” He shook with
eagerness. “Tribesmen, it is my right, for it
was through my doddering old tongue the
secret escaped.... Ask him.” He pointed
to Ravenutzi. “He said so; ask <i>them</i>.” His
great, gnarly arm, like the stump of an oak,
was stretched toward Prassade and Mancha,
and it trembled like an oak when the axe is
at its roots. “Ask them if he did not say so
at the Place of Caves&nbsp;... though I would
have died rather....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was from <i>my</i> hand the Ward was loosed&nbsp;... under <i>my</i> eyes he seduced her mind&nbsp;...
fool, fool!” This was the voice of Waddyn,
who rose up in his place behind Noche, tall
and very gaunt, as some old wolf of the wilderness.
He struck himself on the breast.
“We are old men,” he said, “shall we have
discredit at the last? Chief, are we accepted?”</p>

<p class='c010'>In their eagerness he and Noche had struck
hands together like two children come to beg
a holiday, dropping apart as the murmur of
acceptance ran among the Outliers and made
them men again. “You are accepted,” announced
Persilope. So they sat down again,
each in his place, quite contented.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a little pause here. I was trying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>from where I sat to have a glimpse of Ravenutzi,
to see how this affected him, if at all,
when I heard some disturbance behind me,
and a voice crying out:</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, I cannot lose you both!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I turned, and I saw Prassade stooping to
disengage his knees from his wife’s clinging,
and holding her from him by the shoulders,
begin to speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I also....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Outliers,” he said, and by the hollowness
of his voice and the sinking of his cheek under
the red beard they saw what havoc grief and
disgrace had made in him, “Outliers, it is
through my blood dishonor came, and one of
my blood must cure it. There is none but
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a general outcry of dismayed
protest and assurance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not you, Prassade, not you....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No fault of yours....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She has paid....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She was but a child, she has paid in
full....”</p>

<p class='c010'>And then from the woman at his feet:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Think of <i>me</i>, Prassade.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“Think of what I think on day and night,”
cried Prassade, “and let me go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Prassade,” said the young chief, greatly
troubled, “in that which we propose to do,
when this business is settled, I shall have great
need, as in the past I have had great benefit,
from your interest and advice....”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no!...” The man’s voice was a desperate
gasp merely. “Never shall I give
counsel who could not advise my own child
against dishonor”—holding his wife from
him still, though the poor creature worked toward
him on her knees. “Never shall I beget
children again who have been betrayed by my
own child.... Ah&nbsp;... let me go&nbsp;... let
me go&nbsp;... and by service&nbsp;... by forgetting....”
There was something almost of
madness in his wounded desperation. I suppose
his wife must have seen that. She left
off entreaty and took his hand, fondling it
quietly, turning as she was, upon her knees,
toward Persilope and the elders, quite broken
and submissive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is best you let him go,” she said, “he will
be happier so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Prassade caught at this, his lip was wet with
eagerness.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“Ay, ay, how can I know happiness again?
She knows I cannot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you sure,” said Persilope to the wife,
“that you are prepared for&nbsp;... that you understand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I understand,” she answered back, neither
of them looking at the man in question. “If
it means peace for him, I am....” She
threw out her hands to show how obedient she
was to destiny.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Am I accepted, chief; am I accepted?”
The man trembled with the hope of deliverance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are accepted,” the chief admitted,
seeing there was no one disposed to deny him.
There was a space of stillness in the bright
palpitating noon before Persilope, measuring
the heap of gold and jeweled vessels with his
eye, had turned back and said: “It wants yet
another.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then I saw his wife leaning a little from
where she sat with her glance still fixed and
compelling. I followed it past the line of
elders and found it fixed on Ravenutzi. Before
I could shape in my mind what wordless
urgency lay behind that look, I saw the smith
rise slowly, and stepping carefully among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>rows of seated captives, come and stand beside
Prassade and the two others. Trastevera sunk
backward in her seat with the look of one justified
in a long belief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I,” he said, “offer myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this simple and unexpected intrusion of
the smith into the situation, there burst from
the Outliers a sudden sharp hiss of refusal and
indignation. It was followed instantly after
by harsh ironical laughter. Cries sounded,
here and there two arms and a head cast up,
like the crest of a wolf out of a pack, protestingly,
and hands pulled him down again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The smith, the smith!” they cried. “A
reparation, a reparation!”</p>

<p class='c010'>They were fierce for the moment with the
irony of the situation and their grim enjoyment
of it. Yet, though there was a kind of
justice in making the man who had dared most
to possess the King’s Desire the best keeper of
it, I thought they might easily have found a
better punishment. Ravenutzi was, as I believed,
a man of great sensibility. There must
have been many things in that connection he
would be wishful to forget. And I could not
understand why his willingness to take the
Cup in such company confirmed in Trastevera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>the hope of a latent nobleness in him which
had been her own excuse for her former kindness.
Neither could I any more understand
the unmirthful humor of the Outliers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor, I think, did the Far-Folk then understand
it, looking askance and half hopeful, as
if in spite of everything they expected Ravenutzi’s
wit to bring something out of the
situation to their profit. But the Outliers continuing
to shout: “The smith, the smith! A
reparation!” Persilope was obliged formally
to announce his acceptance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ravenutzi’s part in the reburial of the
Treasure being settled, the four men went to
work to cord it up conveniently for carrying.
Without further ceremony they took tools for
digging and set out from the camp with the
Treasure swung between them. They went
toward the deep forest and by such a trail that,
when they had passed over a little rise of
ground a few hundred yards from us, no one
could see the way they went. No one moved
from his place lest he should accuse himself
of a wish to do so.</p>

<p class='c010'>We sat and watched below us the banner of
the Leap stream through its irised changes,
saw the shadows shrink and stretch toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>afternoon. Sat so still that a little black bear
came out of the manzanita and <i>whoofed</i> and
ran across the outstretched legs of the Outliers,
and a troop of deer trotted up from the
valley and stared soft-eyed at us, skirting the
rim of the hollow. Two or three hours went
over us, and hawks began to dart out of the
scrub to hunt before we heard the four returning.
They were tired, overdone, but they
had bathed at the creek and set their clothing
in order. No soiling traces betrayed where
they had been.</p>

<p class='c010'>They came up and delivered themselves as
for inspection to Persilope. What followed
was very brief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it accomplished?” said the chief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are prepared, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are prepared.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Some slight bequests followed concerning
articles of property, which the chief took as
executor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My young sons&nbsp;...” said Prassade.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then we are ready.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All this time Ravenutzi had not said a word.
One by one the Outliers, as I had seen them do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>with Daria, came up to take their leave. It
was done with a deep and moving brevity. I
came in my turn and cried a little over old
Noche.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you forgiven me for overhearing
what you never meant for me?” said I.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Child, I bless you for it: but for you we
might not have had back again what my prattling
lost.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All this time no one spoke to Ravenutzi.
Trastevera stopped before him for a moment
or two, and some wordless assurance of reconciliation
passed between them. He had not
asked for farewells from his own people and
the Outliers had not suggested it. All being
over, the four men began to walk from the
camp and away from the sun. As they passed
the old King of the Far-Folk, he stood up, biting
his long beard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my King,” said Ravenutzi, speaking
loud that the Outliers might suspect no hidden
communication, “I have done what I
could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“O smith,” said Oca, bitter with impotence,
“it shall be remembered.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They passed on until they had reached a
knoll that lifted them clear of intervening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>scrub. They stood there, turned facing us;
the light, strong against them, made them indistinct,
the wind blurred the folds of their
garments. I looked about expecting one with
the Cup, and saw instead a score of the slingsmen
measuring off their ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>They stood with the sun to their backs and
swung their slings lightly to free them for
action. Until that moment I had not a notion
what was really forward, nor I think had the
Far-Folk. When they heard the slight preparatory
whistling of the slings I saw the wife
of Ravenutzi start as if they had stung upon
her flesh. She looked up and saw the four
standing so quietly and the young men with
their slings drawn to position across the grassy
intervening space. Noiselessly she sprang up
and began running. Swiftly as she cleared the
space between her and Ravenutzi it was not
swift enough. The word was given, the slings
were up and whirling; swifter than birds the
stones took their flight. I saw her leaping on
the knoll and her husband’s arms opened to
receive her, then I heard the singing of the
stones and saw them go down, with her body
across his, all so quietly, as grass is mown in
summer.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>XV<br /> <span class='large'>HOW HERMAN AND I CAME BACK TO BROKEN TREE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Before any bird awoke, and while
the wood was morning gray, the
Outliers began to move westward
next day from Leaping Water.
Morning did not break but there was a widening
of the gray space, a warming of the slight
wind, and then the chill that settled into weeping
fog. Blunt crowns of hills peered at us
through the parting mist, and seemed mysteriously
to move behind it and at the next lifting
peer upon us from another quarter. Dim
files of trees marched down upon us from obscurity
and marched away again. Far to the
left we heard the rain charging the river
cañon, and the stir of invisible cohorts enfilading
behind the locked ranges.</p>

<p class='c010'>I could not make out where we were, except
that our general movement was toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>lower ground, and from the position of a pale
yellow blur that appeared in the sky about
midday, I gathered that we had moved south
and west. In this space of half obscurity, wet
mist, sodden grass, pale shadow and pale sun,
the Far-Folk moved with us. Neither they
nor Herman nor I cared to ask what was meant
toward us, nor speculated as to what we should
do about it. I suppose no philosophy could
have devised more justice in the end than the
working of their own natures had brought to
pass. Whoever had met death on this occasion
had met it so much of his own act that
the event left no sense of mal-adjustment, and
with it died both remorse and recrimination.</p>

<p class='c010'>We had reached by this time, Herman and
I, a large faith in the reasonableness of nature.
Whatever came to us, we felt the processes
of life rising to heal it like the sap to a
tree’s scar.</p>

<p class='c010'>We kept close together, saying little, going
all that day in intermitting fog and rain, until
the sky cleared well toward sunset. We had
come to a halt an hour past on a wild open
headland, and saw huge uncouth shapes of
cloud hurrying to caverns of the sun. Fog
lay thick in the hollows, hills islanded above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>it; as it cleared and sunk and the dry land appeared
we saw how large and good the country
was; hills upon hills, and hills beyond,
wooded and bare, broken and rolling land.
Nowhere was there a man trace, no smoke
going up from the cañons, nor window lights
below the trees. To the west the fog lay unpierced,
stretching seaward, level and roughed
on the surface like waves, beginning to take
a red tinge from the sun. It was not until
then that we had some hint of why we had
halted in this place. We saw the Outliers
drawn up into some sort of order, with the
Far-Folk opposing, and the two chiefs between.</p>

<p class='c010'>We hurried and came up to that privileged
place near Trastevera which her favor reserved
for us, and I observed that the eyes of
Oca burned red like a weasel’s, as he turned
them this way and that on the emerging hills,
fingering his great beard. The glitter of wet
on his shoulders like bronze, touched with reflected
color of the westering fires, the bearskins
that clothed him below, and the blowing
of long lip locks gave him an appearance
most wild and befitting the hour. He looked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>and Persilope looked, standing poised and at
ease as a stag gazing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is a good land,” said the King of the
Outliers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And large.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you say, large,” admitted the King of
the Far-Folk, looking askance, his hands forever
busy with his beard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Large enough for two peoples to live in it,
each unmolested?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Oca’s eyes roved over the whole circle of
the outlook before he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Large enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oca,” said the young man, not the least
troubled by this curtness nor put out by it,
“you have done us as much harm as you could,
which is not so much as you wished. I leave
you to count the good you have got by it. It
was an old quarrel, but it occurs to me that
since the chief cause of it has ceased to exist,
there is little use in our quarreling. But there
is no reason why we should be friends. Do
you follow me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are plain enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will be plainer. Not only do we Outliers
wish no quarrel with you but we wish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>never to set eyes on you again, nor so much
as to happen on the places where you have
been. Therefore if you will choose you out a
quarter of this land, which, as you say, is large
enough, you and your people will have leave
to go seven days in that direction, after which
you shall see no more of us. But all this part
where we have been, from the Ledge to Broken
Tree, is forbidden ground. Neither you nor
any generation of yours to set foot in it. We
will see to that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He spoke with a controlled and quiet energy
that fell on the old man’s fury of defeat like
steady rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As for us, we shall go south from here a
great distance. So,” said Persilope, “if you
choose, to-morrow my men will set you on
your way, and you shall have no more to do
with us except of your own seeking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Oca looked back over his people standing
sullen and attentive, and read but one thought
in them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We would go now,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you will. Only choose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a generous offer, but perhaps Persilope
knew his man. Oca looked north and
south: he must have had by his wild instinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>the better knowledge of the country. He
might have seen in that unstinted gaze some
trace—pale smoke ascending or pointed roof—that
advised him of the neighborhood of
men, men to be plotted against, evaded, pilfered
from, to give to his life the zest of cunning
that it craved. He stretched his hand
northward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will go there,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From those three far peaks, then, to this
broken headland, and from thence as the crow
flies to the sea. Do you accept the conditions?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“O Persilope, what else is there to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go, then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On the motion of Persilope stepping back
all the Outliers fell back a little also to give
them room. We saw the Far-Folk set in motion.
Oca himself went a few paces, but he
was, after all, a king; words of thanks stuck in
his throat no doubt. He dragged them out,
perhaps by the process of tugging at the locks
of his beard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your offer is just. We will keep faith with
you. My thanks to you,” he said, and when
Persilope had dismissed the subject with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>gesture, he turned his back in departing and
did not look our way again.</p>

<p class='c010'>We saw them go down the hill and drown
in the lake of mist, and after an interval come
out on the other side rounding a hill front,
after which we saw them no more. It was a
visible relief to the Outliers to be rid of them.
We moved a space down the headland, made
cover from the rain and slept quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the night all the tide of mist and fog
drained out to sea and left the heavens tender.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the sun we saw that we had come much
nearer the coast than I had realized; we saw
the sapphire spangled belt of the sea lying
low under the hills, and suspected a faint odor
of drying weed mixed with the breath of the
budding forest. Gladness came up with the
sun and sang the love of life awake.</p>

<p class='c010'>Spread abroad seeking food, we heard the
Outliers laughing in the well sunned spaces.
It was still very early and the shadows airy
when they called to us. They came about us
in a ring of friendly faces, and it was so good
a day to be alive in, we had forgotten to be
afraid what they might do with us.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You heard us say last night,” began Persilope,
when we had been brought before him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>a grass walk between the madroños, “how we
should go south from here where the forest
comes down to the sea and there are no House-Livers.
The places where you knew us we
shall not know again.” He saddened at that,
and a shadow of sadness fell on all their faces.
“But I doubt”—here he smiled—“if we were
still there, whether you could find us again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not without your consent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You came to us strangely,” he went on, “in
a strange time, and trouble entered with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not of our making,” Herman reminded
him, “nor our wishing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are sensible of that, and also that we
had good from you. Therefore”—he looked
about on the Outliers and the nudging and
whisper of agreement ran from group to
group of them—“we wish to give you good
in return. We have nothing to give you such
as House-Folk value, nothing but your memory
of us, which we hope you may hold as lovingly
as we do yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We do so,” said Herman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you take that memory then, as our
gift of parting, so to keep it as the best we have
to offer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So to keep it as the best we have to keep,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>consented Herman solemnly, and I after him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why then,” said Persilope, “there is nothing
more for it but to set you on your way to
Broken Tree again, and to wish you Good
Friending.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The good-bys were said very quickly; they
came about us with light laughter and good
wishes and broke and parted into the wood
again. The sun and the spring and the wind
out of the south called them. I sent messages
to Evarra, who stayed in the wood beyond
River Ward to bury Lianth. Trastevera and
some others came down the hill with us. When
we had traveled rapidly for an hour they
showed us the moon-shaped bay and the moon-white
curve of the beach around it, and the
point of cypress running far into the blue
water. Later we could see the white specks
of the houses, and then the close shouldering
hills and the moss-hung pines, the oaks leaning
all one way of the wind, and the sea-blue
slopes of ceanothus. As we went our companions
slipped from us, melted between
sunny space and woody shadow, and mixed
with the brown and green of the wood side.
Now we saw bright regardful eyes and fingers
laid on lips—who knew what men folk might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>be stirring? And now we felt to right or left
the friendly presences. Finally, when we had
been walking I do not know how long, suddenly
there was only Herman and I in the wood,
and no other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Herman, Herman!” I said, “they are gone,
we shall never see them again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked and listened; nothing moved but
the flicker of sun on a wind-stirred leaf or a
winged insect in the green arcades of fern.
Far back we heard the call of jays ending in
a light high note of mocking laughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Herman, shall we never find them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps. Who knows? The trail is very
plain here. If we take pains to notice it, we
might come this way again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, let us keep the trail at least. We
must find the place again. They have not forbidden
us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We followed it close where it left the trees
and ran in the grass between the blossoming
lilacs. Wet folded poppies bent above it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was a good time we had with them. I
cannot bear to think it will never come again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it was a good time. How long was it,
Mona?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How should I know? Do you remember,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>the first day we went in by Broken Tree there
was the first spray of lilac blossoming?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And now all the slopes are blue and the air
too sweet with them. How long is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A long time, I think. I was a professor of
Sociology then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And what are you now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something more, I hope. And—Mona, I
think we are taking the best part of Outland
away with us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I agreed to that too, as we walked between
the blue sprayed fountains of ceanothus, and
felt the swing of the earth under us.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you happy, Mona?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. Though we have lost them, and I
shall never walk alone in the wood again without
hoping to find them. I am happy, but I
do not know why.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And have you quite forgiven me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For what, Herman? I have nothing to
forgive you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For not being more, seeing more in the first
place—for such a number of things. Have
you—quite?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, quite.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We walked on and saw the curdled line of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>the surf, and heard the long sigh that passes
up from the sea along the pines, and smelled
the beaches. All at once I was aware of the
soft springing of the grass under foot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Herman! Herman! Where is the trail?
Look! We have lost it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We looked, and there was the locked wood
behind, and the soft, untrodden turf before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was here by the buckthorn, I think.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the ceanothus; it came out between two
pines.” But though we looked and ran, it was
not in either of these places.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Herman, we shall never find the trail to
that country again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Mona.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, look for it, Herman, come and look!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Herman stood by the ceanothus and looked
at me instead. “Mona,” he said, “the trail is
here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where, Herman?” But I could not look
at him where he stood because of the shining
of his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here, Mona,” he answered with a gesture,
“here!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And I turned and found it on his breast.</p>
